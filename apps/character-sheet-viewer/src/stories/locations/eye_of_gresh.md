## Eye of Gresh: Summary

1. Overview  
   - The “Eye of Gresh” is a nine-room subterranean complex (partly natural cavern, partly Pyramid Order construction, and partly some unknown technology/culture that predates the Pyramid Order).  
   - On paper, the player is hired to retrieve a rare gem (the “Eye of Gresh”) that’s locked in a curious sealed container.  
   - Secretly, an enigmatic figure, Arvan Tel, only cares about the container’s unique metal (“the pelt”), connected to Augurbox lore.

2. Setting & Backstory  
   - The Pyramid Order once used this site for clandestine experiments or rites. The structure features strange geometric corridors and hidden altars. 
   - The structure predates the Pyramid Order, and so some remnants of the original culture can be found too.
   - The site isn’t famous, ensuring that it has remained hidden. Only through exploration (and possibly dialogue with the Loot Eater or other clues) does the player learn the location’s name and the relic’s significance.
   - The site will have a mix of four elements:
     - Very technical, advanced elements (the original culture)
     - Cultish, religious elements (the Pyramid Order)
     - Natural elements (the cavern)
     - The Loot Eater's camp and other traces of the Loot Eater's presence (bones from food, burnt logs from fires, etc.)
   - As the player explores, the site will go from purely natural to religious to technical.

3. Loot Eater Cameo  
   - During the crawl, evidence of the Loot Eater's presence is found.
   - Toward the end, the player will interact with the Loot Eater.

4. Key Narrative Twist  
   - The player believes the Eye (the gem) is valuable. Unknown to them, Arvan actually wants the box the gem is in because it’s made from the same exotic material used in the Augurbox.  
   - Multiple endings revolve around whether the player:  
     1) Discards the box to save the gem (bad outcome).  
     2) Keeps both box and gem together (the authorities confiscate the gem, possibly kill/arrest the player).  
     3) Quietly separates the gem from the box (the authorities only care about the gem, toss the “worthless” box to Arvan, and the player keeps the gem hidden).

5. Nine-Room Dungeon Flow (High-Level)  
   1) Entrance & Sealed Door  
   2) Acolyte Hall (minor puzzle, leftover traces from the Loot Eater)  
   3) Flooded Grotto (hazard check, possibly leftover gear or clues)  
   4) Reflecting Gallery (illusion puzzle referencing Pyramid Order lore)  
   5) Shrine of the Pyramid (combat or obstacle, referencing Order rites)  
   6) Grand Vestibule (a large chamber, item puzzle or mini-boss)  
   7) Loot Eater’s Camp (NPC cameo, cryptic warnings)  
   8) Sanctum Door Puzzle (final step before the relic chamber)  
   9) Relic Chamber (the Eye in a sealed box, triggers endgame scenarios)

6. Ticking Clock & Encounters  
   - The structure is unstable or flooded with noxious gas, imposing a limited number of actions.  
   - Each of the nine nodes has a distinct challenge (combat, puzzle-solving, skill checks).  
   - The final confrontation may involve authorities or local enforcers who only care about seizing the gem.

7. Future Connections  
   - The Eye of Gresh storyline introduces Arvan’s secret quest to reconstruct the Augurbox.  
   - The Loot Eater cameo hints that there are many more curiosities scattered across the Fringe.  
   - This one-shot adventure sets up a broader universe of expansions and continued story arcs.



## Random Thoughts

### Possible Loot Eater Dialogue
Looteater: if your looking for the augurbox, it hasn't been here for 100 revolutions.

Player: I'm not looking for the augurbox.

Looteater: oh, so you're looking for its pelt then? Got myself one a while back. So if you find one here, it's yours.

Player: I'm looking for a gem.

Looteater: The Eye of Gresh? Why would...? [cackles]. That's what you THINK you are looking for. It's worthless.

Player: it's worth 200 sap cans!

Looteater: Like I said. Worthless.

Looteater: I have what I need. I'm ready to drift. Do NOT follow me. This is your only warning.
