## Implementation Notes
When calculating a character's weapon damage:
1. Check if character has a Mech Suit equipped
   - If YES: Use Mech Suit's damage and ignore standard accessory slot
   - If NO: Use standard accessory slot's damage
2. For Armor Class:
   - Mech Suits override both standard armor and accessory bonuses
   - Standard equipment uses normal armor + accessory calculations
