Blybold is shiny, rare, and therefore inherently valuable in the BC jeweler markets. The appetite for gems of any sort of Fringeling origin has become ravenous, riding on the current trend of frontier fetishism among the BC elites. Blybold is also exceptionally hard. Engineers and scientists have yet to substantively research the substance due to it's exorbitant prices, but many theorize that it may have paradigm-changing properties in the realm of material science. So far, any bit that grazes its surface is quickly dulled without making a mark.

## Hivver

Discovered deep within the subterranean cave network beneath Skarem's Scablands, Hivver lichen has spawned a small, but fervent following of prospectors. The seekers of this rare and little-known organism are after the intoxicating gas it produces. Consumption requires special attachments to pipe the gas into helmet breather systems and is not breathable for more than a few moments, but produces a potent psychedelic experience described by travelers as uniquely vivid and transportative. Prevailing rumors suggest that ritual usage can produce life-extending effects. The lichen grows in the crevices of cave walls near underground aquifers and is notoriously delicate. No one yet has been able to successfully transplant the organism, leading to extended camps of gas-huffers to form around Hivver-rich locations. Dried Hivver, however, still fetches a high price in niche BC gastro-markets as a delicacy. The faint bioluminescent glow the lichen produces gives this unique environ its blue hue. Rumors of other fascinating phenomena existing in the "blue" abound. The long terms effects of the gas on humans - and other forms of life - are unknown, though the discovery of the gas' highly combustible nature has lead to an unspoken ban on firearms in the blue caves.

## Skrit

Skrit are small creatures that dwell across the surface of the scablands; typically found near, within, or still attached to Skrit Huts. The life cycle of a Skrit is extremely unique in that males will bury themselves after mating, leaving their tails protruding from the ground within proximity to an existing hut, before entering a terminal catatonic state. Posthumously, it begins a metamorphosis into an extremophyte, resulting in an extension of the Hut, and perpetually producing offspring. Since their discovery, Skrit have been a prime target for poaching; often done by storing Huts, with carcass roots intact, in a Plant Buddy until the young detach.

Listen well kips and you might stay viscous. If ever you find yourself in the flats with nothing to quench  your thirst but dust, remember this stolid chant: Scablands ain't so dry as they look. Divine the Juicebox.  First, search for the distant glint, the shimmer of the scales they use to shade and shed heat. Follow the  flicker and pray it's no heat-curdled mirage. You'll know you're near when you see bundles of straws,  them long noses they use to tap for water. They have a tendency to snap off on the regular and stake the  sand. If you can't dig down you better be fleet fingered. Reckon you can wring one dry yourself if you can  catch hold afore they burrow. Ever see how sodden they get come mating time? Mite unsettling how they  start tapping each other for water, but a strong thirst will quickly put you of similar mind. Just snap off  that straw, insert and squeeze. No worse than a warm mug at the bench if you ask me.

## Scableaf

![Scableaf](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/bJUpaoEXnmqfmPe9CrBloIHPixuGjrpLrE18Nwhr.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

There are few specimens in the Scablands as useful as the Scableaf; an edible species of flora found just under the Scablands dirt. Completely flat and thin, it can grow quite large. Scableaf toughens to a leathery texture as it ages providing a reasonably strong material to be used, like a thick, natural tarpaulin. In addition to providing shade for you and your crew, some drifters can be seen with makeshift hoods or cloaks made of Scableaf. As a food source, it can be eaten raw or handed to a gastrotech for processing. Run your Reef Sweeper along the underside to remove the small spines before prepping, easy enough even for a kip. It keeps for a long time, so pack it with you as a ration, do not waste any of it. Scableaf has become important enough that I've heard some are even trying to domesticate it.

Linno Beetles, native to the Scalbands of Skarem, are notoriously difficult to find. Little is known of their habitats, life-cycle, mating habits, or diet. Legend states that one can only lay eyes on the Linno Beetle if the beetle chooses to reveal itself. As such, these incredibly rare specimens have become regarded as powerful charms, bestowing the bearer with good fortune.

## Dozegrass

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Dozegrass is a brown/orange moss-like plant that can be found scattered throughout the Scablands. Its sleep inducing capabilities are always in high demand amongst Drifters enduring the constant sunlight of the region. Those lucky enough to come across a patch always make sure to harvest it fully. Although chewing on Dozegrass untreated will produce a sleep inducing effect, it has become far more common to make a brew filtering hot water through it. At larger encampments, a mug of Drowser at a fixed time has become a staple sleep ritual for many. This gives the inhabitants a shared experience of the somewhat normal day/night cycle their bodies need. Vastly superior to its synthetic counterparts, dozegrass has seemingly no side effects and is only considered mildly addictive. Many who depart from the Scablands will stock up on Dozeroot supply before leaving, making sure their quality sleep is guaranteed.

## Ommonite

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Ommonite is an extremely rare mineral found in shards near a zone in the Scablands known only as Scream Valley. Usually found in clusters, these shards emit a quiet ominous sound that could be mistaken for a creature. Ommonite itself is vibrating,  caused by its magnetic properties reacting to superconductive meteorite deposits deep beneath Scream Valley. When aligned with a superconductive source of resonance, Ommonite starts to sing! The frequency of these vibrations changes depending on the shard’s orientation. Miners & engineers have discovered that this property can be “tuned” to form a sort of sonic “compass”, which enables accurate navigation of the subterranean tunnels of the Scablands. In larger quantities, engineers are rumored to have rigged ultrasonic projectors to focus the resonance over distance with unpredictable and often lethal results.  This has led to divisive yet fruitful campaigns to harvest Ommonite for weaponization and medicinal uses. Infrasonic researchers are at odds with the Binaural Brainwave scientists.  Even a small shard of Ommonite repays its holder richly in navigational and communication abilities. WARNING: Most people who spend extended periods of time around large quantities of activated Ommonite can develop long-term effects to their health.

This elusive slime mold, native to the Scablands of Skarem, has become a powerful asset for the enterprising miner in the know. It bores into rock to create a viable habitat for its colony, a veritable fortress that both wards evaporation and offers protection. Once a full reticulum has been eroded, the mold colony becomes mobile, capable of carrying its home rock across the flats in search of resources. While most indigenous colonies remain humble in size, housing rocks no larger than the hand, there have been accounts of roving boulders the size of hopper turbines. Ranch Milk gets its name from its adoption by Asteroid Ranchers: mining specialists who seed the mold in asteroids, returning later to harvest the metals the caustic mold leaves behind.

## Pelgrejo

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Pelgrejo roam the scablands consuming sweet flavored flora and algae. They have a large digestive chamber that acts as a fermentation vat. There are 3 layers of substance within the shell. The top layer consists of liquid that has been recently ingested. This layer has a sharp taste and when consumed makes you feel warm and hazy, they call it “Grey Juice”. The middle layer is a thicker substance that has become highly valuable to Gastrotechs. It’s primarily used as a sauce in luxury cuisine which they refer to as “Sweet Gravy”. The third layer is a sticky substance that is used as an adhesive. They call this layer “Grey Glue”, because of its strong bonding agent

## Brember

**Author:** Helmets & Masks

When prospectors, rustlers, and the like chant of striking it rich in the Fringe, it is often iridescent visions of brember that tantalize the lobe.  Perhaps the most famous luxury export from The Fringe, the ancient petrified resin has become a rite amongst the highest tranches of the Beshtalan elites. The gems are polished, faceted, and flaunted in jewelry and all manner of furnishings - the proud bearers willfully ignorant to the countless evacuated lungs and frozen veins that infuse their acquisition. The first brember deposits were discovered amongst the Rocky Cloud, the Fringe’s largest working asteroid field. The Cloud remains the site of most brember prospecting, though the asteroids are many and those rife with brember tendrils are few and far between. As it scrapes, no surface-bound brember deposits have ever been discovered, leaving most to assume their ancient origins hail from a shattered planet long extinct. Some even believe the primordial organic matter calcified within possesses mystic powers. While several scientific guilds have mused toward unique applications of the material, its popularity as a luxury good and consequent high price have thus far curbed any significant research into novel use-cases.

Not a lot of crews are a fan of relying on something you can’t jerry-rig, especially when it reeks. But a Scrubbie nestled by a heatsink can make long hauls a bit less stuffy. They can be a bit fickle, gotta feed the lil’ shits on a strict schedule and they happen to have a tendency to detach themselves and float around leaving you to sniff them out. A sprinkle of sweetener is all they need to recycle some of the c02 scrubbing the air to technically be cleaner, but the process reeks of ass gas and that's with natch sweeteners. In a pinch, any synth sweetener will help it get through a cycle or two till you get something better, but you best be prepared with sick bags.

## BG-1 Gastropod

Gerrick & Tonerly approached The Borsh Conservatory Of Gastrocraft to develop a prototype of the GASTROPOD, a device to aid the nutritional needs and scarcity of resources in potentially hostile and remote environments. Comes with a starter spore pack that develops fungi which will convert asteroid rubble into healthy nutri-soil which can then be used for food.
It proved so successful, production of the BGT-1 rolled out soon after, becoming a key inventory item of any deep void mission. Every gastro worth their cream packs as many as there are crew. One pod will sustain, nurture and feed them throughout a mission.. There are many unique aspects to this kit. Firstly, a starter pack comes with a powerful asteroid fungal spore kit, converting toxic space rock into mineral rich soil. Handy when adrift or lost in the void and supplies are low. A kit can sustain nutrition once a minimal soil base has been prepped. Then an assortment of protein rich fungi can be grown as life support rations. Solar panels, modes for soil breakdown or plant growth. Timer controls and bio/grav sensors create the right environment to enhance spore production. Every Gastro is trained in its use and they can be daisy-chained to cater for larger crews. A variety of Spore Packs can be purchased in advance. Both Borsh Conservatory of Gastrocraft and Gerrick & Tonerly run regular marketing campaigns warning of the dangers of a thriving black market which has opened up due to demand for jailbroken and knock-off imitation pods as well as “experimental” spores and seeds.

## Ivory Tar

Dentistry is cost prohibitive for most crews and local practitioners tend to be crude and can only be found in the more established settlements, leaving most Drifters to fend for their own teeth if they intend to keep them. Many turn to Ivory Tar. Ivory Tar is a chewable dental health product made from prehistoric crude oils, artificial flavors and refined chemicals. Each tablet has two sides (light and dark). When kneaded together the two sides of the tablet break down into a dark chewy sticky tar. The Ivory Tar fills cavities and promotes a strong jawline, but it can stain the teeth. It’s intended for a single use, but in some crews it’s considered good luck to chew on the same piece of tar for the duration of a void journey.

A rare mineral mined from an asteroid used to augment tattoo ink. In its native form Figment displays properties of attraction and coherence. Individual particles seek to cluster together; governed by unseen forces. This animation provides the shifting sand with its tell-tale shimmer.
Drifters incorporate figment to adorn the skin with art that can shift and alter its appearance, images to which it also lends its name. Encountered rarely in the Fringe; these Figments immediately endow the bearer with a certain amount of implied status, daring or wealth. Nowhere is this more apparent than the elaborate full body figments of some Beshtala-Chanko elites.
Their technical mastery has also given rise to rumours of a more clandestine purpose, such as signifiers of secret societies concealed beneath the skin or the encoding of illicit messages on go-betweens (unwitting or otherwise). Given the elite's penchant for secrecy; what becomes of these messengers after delivery is subject of some speculation.

## Yum Nubs

Ain’t a single thing in these sweets that’s natural, but that’s why they never spoil. Yum Nubs are pretty much the only thing that surely won’t go curdled on the trek from BC to the Fringe. Engines, gastro pods, fuel, and crew can all let you down but Yum Nubs will never go bad on you . Most rations of Yum Nubs don’t make it to Skarem or outer reaches of the void since most kips lack enough self control to stave sweet cravings, just makes the ones that make it there that much more valuable. For those long hauls, sometimes the included sticker is the only exciting thing you'll get for days. Drifters stick ‘em in all sorts of places, swear I saw some kip covering half their helmet with the dang things, could hardly see out of it. Really raises the question of where he got all those Yum Nubs in the first place... Back at the bench, heard mention of a recluse hoarding a whole freight of them somewhere in the Scabbies. They say they got a glimpse of them one day out by Lykenrot pre-shootout wearing some khulark mask leaving wrappers of Yum Nubs in the dust.

## Murk Ring

The Voidcloud makes all the fastest routes through the void untenable for most pilots. Step up to the bench at any port and you’ll hear tales, tall or not, of a mysterious siren song. The song starts as an intoxicating hum that inexorably shifts into screams of abject terror and doom as it consumes all matter it touches, ships and drifters alike. The Voidcloud is a hive mind eusocial organism that lives in deep space, its movement is sporadic and unpredictable outside of rumor and legend. They say it follows gravity, light, or maybe heat. Few ships navigate through Voidcloud space without trouble, and many are never seen again. The difference is mastery of the Murk Ring. Its inventor is a mystery. If you imbue a small sample of Voidcloud matter into this apparatus, it acts as a compass for the skilled Longhauler. A queenless hive is harmless and docile, but proximity to the hive will make it sing and surge in the direction of the Voidcloud. Pilots lucky and savvy enough to fly with a Murk Ring can use that signal to stay alive. Best to make sure you’re one of them.

## Astersilk

![Astersilk](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/BZYZ6c4fl73S9GqVmQRsavnEOpFhDaFtTtO8TsTs.png)

**Element Code:** HOME

Discovered accidentally by a team of chemists, Astersilk was immediately marketed to asteroid miners as a cheap and easy solution for "dross mining" (gathering valuable materials in asteroid dusk). Soon after its release, though, ever-ingenious drifters discovered a multitude of practical uses for the "web in a can" like tethering items to an asteroid, settling the dust beneath a spacecraft, sweeping dust away, temporarily patching flexible materials, and many others. This in turn led to a new occupation: the "silker". A good silker can spin makeshift gaskets and grommets, flexible containers, signposts, and even toys and artwork. Mining crews in low gravity often employee a dedicated silker to stand guard to catch stray tools (and even the occasional drifter) that would otherwise float off into oblivion.
Usage directions from an astersilk canister:
Directions for dross mining (steps 1-7) and debris containment (steps 1-2):


Point nozzle in direction of loose mineral site.


Spray site in a spiral motion starting at the outside of the circle and spiraling in toward the center making sure every concentric ring is touching the previous ring.


As you reach the center, slow the flow and raise nozzle over the circle pointing down.


IMPORTANT: take care not to break the line of astersilk between the center pool and your nozzle.


Hold position for 3 minutes and then give the line a slight tug, if the circle moves with the tug, you can now reel in your haul. Otherwise, wait a few more minutes until it is set.


Drop your haul (both minerals and astersilk) into canister.


At your convenience, pour alcohol into the canister to dissolve astersilk.

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Mining asteroids and comets is a competitive and toilsome trade. The suits/gloves/wearables can rip and tear if caught on a jagged edge, in a battle with another mining crew, etc. Rips can be fixed quickly by applying the applicator syringe into the suit where the tear is. Needs to be applied within 20-30 seconds. When applied the COAG in the syringe will give a short blast of oxygen to restore breathing, then it bubbles and solidifies to recreate the seal in the suit. Most spaceships are sold/outfitted with the COAG units as an upsell.  There are refillable COAG cartridges. The COAG has a duration of 12-36 hours, after which it begins to deteriorate and the seal breaks down. The duration will be shorter in the presence of solar flares or if exposed to high heat.
