## The Beetle

Seven kilograms of pure utility, the Beetle was a joint production of the engineering polymaths at Dorty & Dorty and the head gastros of Belstrom's restaurant empire. Frontal mandibles allow hands-free processing delicate enough to savor karmin pinkgrass, but bulking enough torque to crush a prongshell. The headpiece contains a hefty battery and dual banks of data gelatin necessary for long excursions in the field (though it may test the tensile strength of your spinal ligature). Not to mention the cartridge player that lets you spin the Collected Works of Dorty Dorty. "First Footsteps in the Fringe" is a must; "Dining with Father" close behind, and a surprising source of insights on Dorty Dorty's manufacturing principles. It doesn't get better than this. Ask around.

## Muckface

![Muckface](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r164.png)

**Author:** Fancy Karl

Hyperspec gastros, fuck me. Never seen this strange chimera in the wild myself, but I heard tales of muck divers on Pavreck (I think) that mixed the obtuse arts of hyperspec and gastrotech. Rootin' for scrub tubers and bog pearls, I believe. The muck'll suck you down into zero-vis oblivion, so hyperspec the only route if you want any form of perception beyond dull sensation through rubber fingertip. Venonauts, in all likelihood, as scrub tubers house a potent neurotoxin that'll fetch a mean price if harvested clean. Venonauts dabble in all manner of high-tox consumables. Tis a rare breed that makes for an adept poison poacher and then if you layer some hyperspec madness into that bake, I 'spose it starts to make sense why someone would put scrub tubers in their mouth, machine or otherwise. Gives me the creeps though. Also heard half them muck divers don't ever come up. Not because they get lost, but because they don't wanna leave. If I strain, I reckon I could imagine that immersion in that thick, warm muck with a hyperhat tickling my brain could have a womb-like appeal. I wonder how many are still twitching and tasting in the mud and at what point, by virtue of the nature of their new existence, do they begin to slink past the boundaries that marcate their original species.

## Bincal Mouth Machine

![Bincal Mouth Machine](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r144.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Pettrik Dilkie

Lightweight and the first mouth machine to recognize the importance of olfactory stimulation for the palate. LRB914-filtered noz tubes allow for safe scent-tests in the field, with a bypass mechanism that solves the well-documented difficulties of breathing in most mouth machines (also solved, independently, by the engineers of The Beetle). Gastronaifs extol the replacement of heavy data gelatin cartridges with Bincal's Mouth Foam. But as Dorty Dorty once said, bravely confronting a rabble of strikers, "There is never gain without loss, my friends." The limited capacities of the foam necessitate shorter stints in the field and frequent attention to pressure gauges on the back of one's own head is - irksome. The Bincal's jaw is wide enough to accommodate an afulsk shell. However, anyone who has mistaken a fulsk shell for an afulsk shell can testify that even replacing the noz tubes will not entirely purge the putrid stench of pulverized fulsk flesh from one's mouth machine, memory, and dreams!

## The Sullken Smile

For this strange mask, there are only theories. Possessing no mechanical features, it hardly seems right to call the thing a mouth machine. Not that shoons and dust-huffers care for calling a thing by the right name. Why dust? Because all extant masks come from excavations of the Outer Dunes of Dranag, where legions of Sullken pilgrims and their putrilous oils were buried beneath the Great Dust Gale. Take a bludgeon to one of these masks and you will find the segmented carapace of the masks are constructed from some reedy, fibrous material, coated in clay and baked at high temperatures for a smooth finish. Behind the teeth are shallow bowls, like a mouth with the tongue carved out. Soot stains indicate that, perhaps, the masks may also function as enormous pipes used during ceremonies to achieve ecstatic visions. Others suggest there is no functional purpose beyond intimidation of strangers. Still others, that these terrifying visages were donned during orgiastic holy days and banquets and used for erotic purposes. The Sullken have provided no illumination, and have instead reappropriated - nicked, dragged, pilfered - as many of the masks as they have found.

## The Saav

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Pettrik Dilkie

The most light and comfortable of all the mouth machines, popular among wilderness explorers because of its singular purpose: pickling. The Saav's mechanical tongue processes matter both soft and hard without difficulty, feeding into a thermal chamber that flash-heats the substances, sundry, before they are sealed in tubes of acetic acid. Refined palates might object to the pungeal and viscous glop produced by this mouth machine. But those whose minds ferment in lower matters - pounding rocks, polishing rocks, peddling rocks - might gravitate towards the Saav due to its simple mechanism. Heat and acid are common solutions to unknown or noxious bacteria - reliable until the standard issue Sheleagh batteries corroded and the thermal chambers merely warmed the infusoria within. One might proffer this corrosion as the best possible explanation for the grisly end of the Coron-Tosam expedition, but one might also object to having one's fingers removed from one's hands by vengeful brutes. In any case, the secret is in the name: Sheleagh's Acetic Acid Ventures.

## The Bald Beetle

Some know-nothings call this the "bald" version of The Beetle, but others will call it "scalped" instead. Not only because these mouth machines are only available second-hand, but also because they are products of crude dismemberment. Drifters lacking commitment to gastronomical delights might prefer losing the heavy "extras" on top, which does make the Beetle considerably lighter and more comfortable. No one questions that. You still get those hefty mandibles, they say. But at what cost? Consider the loss of the data gelatin banks and voice cartridges. Gone, all the works of Dorty Dorty! Gone, the analytic components designed by the finest engineers in the Fringe! Gone, the lifetime warranty! Dorty Dorty might have thought of these abominations when she wrote, "There will always - always, my friends - be parasites who profit from the labor of others."

## Charybdis

![Charybdis](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r141.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Pettrik Dilkie

This model is only capable of processing smaller samples, but its rotary style mouth shreds them to the width of a single gastrodet, allowing for poly-chemical analysis of samples while maintaining the integrity of rare specimens. Sure, that means tiny discoveries that other mouth machines would miss. And yes, Charybdis was an immensely profitable product for Nevil's Gastrocraft. Everyone knows that. What not many drifters discovered until it was too late is that Charybdis requires constant cleaning and maintenance to prevent rust and that the standard issue filters are not small enough to trap spores. The outfitters folded when Valk Nevil himself endured a fungal bloom in his lungs. Too bad. But that's what happens when you hire freight mechanics instead of qualified engineers. Mouth machines are delicate ergonomic crafts, not greased up cogs and screws.
