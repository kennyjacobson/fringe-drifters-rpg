## 001 - BURIED TREASURE

![001 - BURIED TREASURE](https://i.seadn.io/gae/WPiOfty5VCjRLHRe6u2WBdkSYLZvOD-eQn4slgFp9rv1esn6BhSWnCo52AURW6CEyouvEPxaM_XxI54ZeRuzx8o3rssHh9d7rcM5tg?auto=format&w=3840)

So I’m sittin quiet, minding my own juice down at the Sowing Season. You know the one. Best mugbar in The Bench by my reckoning. Just the right shade of dank with a nice warm cast and none of that horrible flicker that plagues so many of the other pubs.

All abrupt-like, this cleanface drifter shades the hatch and just stands there leering for a beat. Rightaways I peg her as a freshie. Look at this kipper, I says to myself, must be lost cuz ain’t no cleanface ever grace the ole Sow by choice.

But despite her shine, she thrusts forth, moving with intent, straight to pinch the space right beside my own. She flags a mug without so much as a glance to the barkeep and fixes gaze straight on my dumb box. A strong first brush. Stronger than I ‘spected. It’s not often I call em wrong, but her manner had me guessing my read.

I asks her business and she chants something lofty of merchandise, which straightshot just means she a smuggler. And if I know smugglers, it’s never just one trade. But twas her next query that had me chicking spittle. Treasure maps, she says, presuming I knew of such things.

First I laughed, but then she chants of some rustler named Mito and his load of brember and the ole box felt a shudder. Twas a thought long-faded, but the phonics rang true somewheres down deep. Then the coin she slid across the bar cranked the starter and it all started coming back…

Mito. Crossed the poor rustler in that dump of a pub on Earlie Prime. This was seasons back. Back when I was prospecting fresh claims for that treacherous Round Power family. He had a skiff and was looking to chisel some ore. A rustler tale old as Chanko. Small time. Just him and a young ward.

They’d scored big in brember in the Rocky Cloud over Skarem. Take any rustler’s claim of payload and cut in half to tick closer to the truth, but Mito here was chanting of crystal fountains. Filled an exo-can and went back for more. No matter how you cut it, that’s a life’s load.

In all my cycles, I’ve found fortune always be seeking equilibrium. Over time, a glut of good always yields bad in equal measure. Fringe be like that. Though not often so swiftly nor thoroughly as in the case of Mito the Rustler.

Soon as they punched squares back to market they thread lines with a pair of Roving Terror craft. When it comes to pirates, the Terror are the creamiest of the bunch. Not who you wanna scope with a bloated exo-can on the belly of your skiff. Must’ve looked like a paunchy-ripe ginge melon.

Credit due, Mito and company strapped a tracker to their can and dumped it down into the Scablands. A fast thought for rustlers so young in tradeyears. The simple transponder would grant them the right squares to reclaim their bounty and the dumped mass allowed them to skirt away from a Terror-ful fate.

Loads-free for the time and fuel still in the tank, these two rustlers go circle back for another round on their brember font, but this time - as fortune flows - the enforcers were on patrol. Horvo Mineral hires some mean mercs to hold their sway in the Rocky Cloud and Mito was jumping their claim.

In the scramble to scramble, Mito’s partner got the chain break. It happens. You punch the mag-miner off a mite too heavy and the shock snaps your tether, tossing you flapping out into The Void. Kip move. But the bad luck here was that those Horvo mercs were dropping in hot. Mito was forced to flee for his life while his partner became a floater…the truest form of drifter, I reckon.

But here’s the real rubber. Partner had the receiver for their brember can on his person. Without it, ain’t no way to track down that treasure. Mito circled back once the sector cooled, but boy was nowhere to be found.

There be a trove of brember fit to upgrade a whole clan buried in the Scablands of Skarem and the key to it all is likely floating the cloud, frozen to a corpse.

I reckon Mito still be out there asking anyone who’ll turn ear if they seen his boy, too full of regret to admit he’s dead and shattered. What was the boy’s name again?

Started with a G…

## 002 - LOOT EATER

![002 - LOOT EATER](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/951278621467742258/992096899270201384/Loot_Eater.jpg?width=1374&height=1169)

Not spent much more than a tick in the Scablands of Skarem, always seemed like folly to me. No pathways carved yet, as it were, but reckon that’s part of the allure. If that’s your cadence.

Every drifter I’ve crossed who truly stinted those parts had a peculiar churn to them.

No big corpo ops out in them Scablands. Lots of squares yet to be marked. It’s that fog - the climmering question of what lies within and the unconcern as to prospects of cream or bad sap - that brims the pot of the right wash of drifter. Untilled soil. Open to anyone to lift the lid on discovery.

Once loaded some botanicals out of that green Iris, right on the demarcation that borders the Scablands, the rock. Twas right on the breach into those vast cut channels that I encountered an odd sort of loner. Her tenor has since marked my impression and defined the ethos of the Scablands. At least by my slice of cake.

Called herself the “Loot Eater.”

Wouldn’t give me any other name. Clearly a drift name, but one that I got the sense she may have given herself. She was no tourist though. That was clear as. A roaming native one becomes when you camp the wild more than a season.

But there were an odd twinge in her whiff. Her enthusiasm almost caused me discomfort. Seemed to curdle past the edge of reason. Her passion was absolute. No regard for tradecraft or coin. I just couldn’t relate. Where I saw desert and a stretched stay, she saw hidden treasures.

“Eater,” I said, still the skeptic, “So what loot do you trade in round here?” I was met with a right wave.

Did I know there were lizard with a diamond-shaped skull mucking deep in the crater bowls on the 37th ringline? Or that there’s a crystal that glows red that no one ever seen before that she found runs the Iris border? And apparently the pirates and jumpers holding fast among the Scabs are not so clever with how they hide their prizes - marking holes with saluting totems of stacked rocks.

“So you steal from the pirates, and then hawk the loot?” I ask, trying to find footing. Nay. Just moves it, concealing them better than their own keepers. What? For the thrill of making it disappear? I scratch my scalp.

Heard chant that for several months the Scablands was hit by a thundering dust storm that punted most drifters to packing. Her reply, “Never was a better time to find rare loot!” The searing sands and shifting landscape served well to reveal new prizes for the Loot Eater.

Her tales of odd quests for odd treasures seemed drawn from a bottomless cistern, but her ramble rolled such that, as a collector of tales, I did something I rarely do. I interrupted her.

The completion of the puzzle still eluded me. I asked her when did she actually profit? Had she not already accrued a fortune and shouldn’t she take her winnings back and live out her days like royalty?

That froze her tongue. At least for a moment. She stammered that it would be foolish to leave now with so much loot still out there.

She asked if I wanted to come help her find some cache of brember rumored to have been jettisoned nearby. I shook my head and she quickly left. Squishy thing is she left a rough cloth  bag. Inside were a shiny assortment of precious stones - a two-stretch haul for some. She just left it and it didn’t feel like it were in error.

I speculate she didn’t care about riches at all. They just slowed her down. She had a fire in her stomach for expedition, the irresistible scratch of the pursuit - the object at the end need only be worth pursuing. And here criteria were broad.

Every Scablands drifter I’ve encountered since has had at least a drop of this sort of blood in their veins. The fog. The itch. This is what I’ve come to learn drives drifters to the Scablands. And it’s a rare sort that wants it.

## 003 - The Augurbox Expedition

![003 - The Augurbox Expedition](https://i.seadn.io/gae/qqFQ0crWnXfkU472kLqsY1Jiq6h3ng5W0OA0vHBb2VrbNNE4AJBIoLFkahQFe6Pe3JdlBA-O48M3hsL5J3smFfaREOHiXhr1PcARGQ?auto=format&w=3840)

Our humankind has bloated and collapsed many times, captured stars now faded from memory, settled and re-settled, rooting and then reaching, over and over. On the eonic timescale, I reckon we look like fickle nomads.

Tis a schoolroom tale, told with placid authority, sponged by us all in youth without much thought. But the truth is not so clean as that, as we come to grasp with age...or not. The map is stained, epochs lost to the creases. Cobbled from fragments.

Truth is we don’t know much of anything. And every several seasons, something leaps from the fog and reminds us of our collective imbecility.

I’ve crossed routes with more than a few peddlers of OLD WORLD TECH in my time. Their pitch is always the same. The ancients were far more advanced that we are now, yet their artifacts still live among us, scattered across the cosmos like droppings, waiting for their chosen host to bring their inert magic back to into the plane of the living.

I tend to breeze the hawkers ‘cause junk is junk, but their steel remains stropped despite my aged wisdom. The scam works. It works because, every once in a while, it’s true.

Dob Hessian dropped into the Scabbies way back when I was still wobbly and throwing chaff. This story is an old one, but comes by way of a survivor of the Hessian Crew, prattled in fragments from the slack jaw of the Bench crawler she’d become.

The Hessian Expedition was well-endowed for the time. Dob had some modest lineage with channels to pools that could finance his whimsy. Quipt with not one, but two gastros. A full hand of specialists...survivalists, geologists, and the like.

And Dob was captain, hungry for Coe-Kopum deposits he had convinced both financiers and crew lay copious beneath the sediment. Skarem was a fountain of wealth and they would helm the spigot, so he said.

But Dob also pakt a rare piece of kit, held close and clamped like a nursing pran. For Dob’s eyes and fingers only, clacking the keys with wary glances. We know now, his precious piece was THE AUGURBOX. And only after they were well unchocked did he let slip that this Old World device held the power to pinpoint their treasure in the vast, convoluted wastes of Skarem.

They dropped right atop the edge of Iris as most crews do, taking on fresh water and whatever their gastros could forage in jungle. Dob would then consult with the Augurbox in solitude, plotting their course in concert with a machine.

Only took one cycle for the scrapes to pile up. The geologist, upon scoping the terrain that lay in their way, took issue with Dob’s optimistic portrait of the mission. Harsh whispers flew back and forth and resulted in the geo attempting to flee back to the jungle. But he was captured and bound, held tight as a crude lesson of the importance of crew cohesion.

Deeper and deeper into the wavery heat they trekked and their geologist’s traitorous wisdom soon proved prescient. Gruel and strain is no stranger in The Fringe, but the Scablands scrape at you a little more furiously than the rest. Dissent began to brew, borne of suffering.

Now suffering is one and swell if there’s the scent of bounty, but the core samples offered no hope and the water supply waned. The gastros struggled, confounded by the environ and squeezed by Dob’s insistent pace which grew more feverish by the cycle. Perhaps the tip that permitted them to crawl as far as they did was the happenstance discovery of Juicebox rodents and their fluid-filled bellies.

The chant flows that every cycle come campset, Dob would scuttle away with his precious box, leaving his crew to fester while he communed with the oracle. Atop all the pressures he allowed his crew to endure, this might’ve been the glaze that set the whole gang alight.

During one of Dob’s sessions, he was heard yelling. By account of our gastro-orater, she’d had enough of the shroud and snuck to spy her captain’s chatter. What she heard was spark to tinder.

Metaphorically prostrate afore the electro-creature, the captain was pleading. Begging for intel. And not just over coordinates and timescales, but - most surprising of all - over the contents of their pillage. No mention of the promised Coe-Kopum. That was a ruse. Dob instead begged for the Augurbox to reveal what the promised treasure might be. He didn’t know. And this whole toilsome errand was on behalf of the cryptic crunching of an age-addled computer.

The young gastro brought this back to the crew and as a testament to their fiber, the ensuing confrontation remained civil. He rebuffed them at first, but soon realized he no longer commanded any sort of loyalty. Then he started begging.
▾ ▾ ▾

He had encountered The Augurbox on a pilgrimage to the temple of the Hindlands on Beshtala. Some monk was hawking tickets to ask the device questions. Dob was so taken by the experience that he offered to buy it outright. Only after an offer of the bulk of Dob’s family fortune did the monk concede and the box was clamped. The way Dob spoke, it was as if the machine had chosen him for this mission, the desperate gloss of higher purpose shining through his eyes. No, there was no Coe-Kopum in the Scablands, but that didn’t matter. The treasure they were seeking was far greater, or so he insisted. He chanted wild of ancient relics, Old World artifacture brought back to life. Priceless. But when pressed for specificity, all he had in turn was lofty apologetics to the fidelity of his pet.

The fact that they slept that night without so much as a stake thrown is a miracle in itself, but come wake time, their marksman and pilot were absentee. They executed their escape with more savvy than the geologist and could not be tracked, not that Dob’s muscle would be so inclined at this point anyways. My gastro friend demanded to speak to the Augurbox itself and with the unanimous and glareful support of the crew, Dob conceded.

The Augurbox gave her no satisfying answers. She resorted to threats. The box closed up.

The inevitable mutiny was simple enough. The entire party decided to head back while they had enough Juiceboxes in sack daisy-chain their way back to the Iris. Dob cursed them. He even fired a couple shots at them wildly as they left, though it’d be a stretch to assume he intended them to strike meat. He was last seen at a great distance hefting the Augurbox himself, dragging them both deeper into the heat.

This story is an old one. Could have easily lost it in my own brain haze had the name AUGURBOX not rang out once again and cracked the gears from their crust. The ancient computer has resurfaced.

It now lives in the pocket of the increasingly famous Loot Eater, probably one of the only Drifters capable of going hard enough in the Scabbies to intersect Dob’s deadly trail and find the thing. What I’ve heard is that the box - as seems to be its wont - has spurned her. Whatever mechanical intelligence lies in that thing has decided our species too fickle a collaborator to execute its aims and it’s gone quiet. Might be the clearest take yet? I get the feeling its intentions may outlive us all.

## 004 - Old World Treasure

No coin comes easy, but if you got a beat to brew and a nose for ripe payload, reckon you’ll feather this tale. Who ain’t got taste for good cream, yeah? Yeah.

So I’m sitting at the Sowing Season per usual minding my own mug, when this rattled drifter shades the hatch. Cagey like a fry-bird on the block, but sure as shit weren’t no kip. That was clear as the vac-rings round his neck. He’d been under pressure.

Now I ain’t one to slip mugs on no account, but the drifter looked like he needed a taste and I got more vouchers in my cast than time to grog, so scraped a drink off the froth and slid it his way.

Weren’t too grateful. Queried on friar-gas and when I says I got no business with fiends, you could see the shame in his shoulders. No lean drifter needs to turn toward the haze for solace. True as a Grom rails, a sip or two started to shed his shakes.

That’s when the chant got wild.

I asked him what he seen that got him hankering for the gas. After a weighty tick as the terror stewed silent in his skull, two words simmered up and dripped out of his bonebox…

VELLUM SHALE.

If you haven’t mise nor matter to scratch with antiquities, as I reckon you don’t, V-Shale is rarer than rare. A supermaterial of the Old World. Light as sheet plastic, but strong and pliable and electro-conductive. I ain’t never seen it with mine own, but when they say them Old World ships had wings, I reckon it was the shale on display. Shimmering in all colors.

Material of myth it remains. The ore gone extinct ages back after they heat-domed the whole planet with over-eager extraction towers. So rare, merchants will spit flips if they catch whiff of even a tile of the stuff. A carriage-load would buy a neat fleet.

This drifter’s chant came in starts and stops, but eventually I gathered that his crew found a surveyor station. Strange craft of yore. Light-riding longhaulers for the Old World explorers of the deep fringe, many of which never made it back to berth, left to drift in the ether like the rest of us.

The carcasses still float, but they’re impossible to track down. Sometimes you catch galley-chant of a sighting - always by chance. A shiny castle in the distance, drifting back toward home.

I plied for more, but all the drifter said was that he had a carriage full of v-shale and that all he wanted was to get his payday and go warm some deep hovel.

I’m more interested in foul tales than a hot tip and you could tell by his tenor that shit got sweaty, but he bucked my queries. To shut me up, he let slip that his crew could’t pinch the whole pot. There were stacks more on the rig. He scrawled the coordinates on his napkin and left me to stew on the treasure map.

If you’re angled to believe the prophesies, I got them here - the ticks that’ll take you to the surveyor, still hanging creamy reams of vellum shale for the plucking.

I got no drip for my own expo. Those seasons are long past. Crews be crouchy and quipment be heavy and I got all I need here at the Sow to grease what cycles I got left, so you can have ‘em if you got the fire.

But word to warder: if you’re gonna chase this cream, pick your crew with care. Take heed of how they’re quipt and what badge they brandish. Stack skills, kit, and affiliations for the job at hand, but also for what you cannot plan, be they threats or opportunities.

The Void is dark and full of secrets.
The crossing, long and treacherous.

Be wary of pirates and other such predators.
Be wary of restlessness and hunger.
Ward contamination of both mind and body.

Keep taut.
Ready to work and ready to fight and ready to follow the trail…for not even Margul knows where it might lead.

If your crew is shit, you will die. Or worse - be forced to live out the rest of your seasons tipping mugs and huffing gas to dull the sting of the plunder left unpillaged, squares left unpainted, the life you could have led.

Stay smooth, drifter. Herd your pack and go get that cream.

## 005 - THE GREAT OLD WORLD TREASURE HUNT

Welcome, drifters.

A few cycles ago, many of you passed under the hatch of the Sowing Season and had the pleasure of trading chant with Duzi, the Bench's premiere keeper of tall tales.

To recap, Duzi had recently crossed paths with a solo drifter, who was left rattled from his recent quest for an extremely rare and extremely valuable Old World supermaterial called Vellum Shale…

Vellum Shale is one of the many ancient artifacts left behind by a previous civilization - a civilization that rose and fell before the Gigarian Dark Ages and the subsequent Chanko Renaissance.

The artifacts they left behind were integral to the reintroduction of spaceflight and other technologies, but many we've yet to fully understand still remain scattered across the Occupied Spaces.

This lone drifter appeared to be his mission's only survivor. In his brief encounter with Duzi, he was reluctant to recount what truly happened, but he left behind the coordinates to the source of the V-Shale: an abandoned Surveyor Station…an Old World exploratory craft.

If the coordinates are true, this could be the tip of all tips. Even a small amount of Vellum Shale would recoup the cost of travel with profits to spare. And the way this drifter talked, there should be enough to fill a whole cargo carriage.

Now, there's not a drifter with fluid still in motion that'd waver over such a prospect and it appears that all of you, after hearing this tale, became ravenous to pinch the pot.

But a quest of this caliber is no solo operation. You need a crew. A close-knit and varied crew, ready to grind through the void and confront the unknown.

Over the last few cycles, you've gathered your crew. A lean team of five to tackle the perils that undoubtedly stand between you and this prospective bounty.

For some of you this was an easy task, a well-worn cohort of attuned drifters already in your pouch. For others, new alliances had to be forged - a twitchy endeavor, but smoothed by the promise of loot.

The five of you now stand at the Bench's rack hatch, tools and provisions in tow.

The buzzer blares and the hatch opens, releasing you to lash straps and mount your steed.

Now all that's left is to see how you fare.

Packed tight into your spacecraft, the course is plotted and the route quickly has you passing through the Faye Cloud - a field of dense gas suspended in space. The gas scrambles all scopes, preventing any communication, tracking, or computer-assisted navigation.

While this seems perilous, seasoned pilots welcome the extra cover the cloud provides. It's a blind flight, but there's comfort in the soft static of the distorted scopes.

You can't see anyone, but if they're out there, they can't see you either.

It's a several-cycle crossing and spirits are high. Anticipation simmers as some of you fantasize about the life changes that will be paved by the forthcoming payload.

But this respite from the vast, shelter-less void is only temporary. As you near the edge of the cloud, subtle tensions begin to simmer and - as is the case more often than not - these subliminal warning bells are not unfounded.

Your ship unceremoniously breaches the cloud. In an instant, the veil is lifted. The blanket of fog falls away and you're now flying exposed, surrounded by swaths of big black emptiness.

As soon as the ship's sensors regain their clarity, a harsh blip abruptly cuts through the silence of the cabin. On the monitor blinks the last thing you want to see: two dots.

A shiver runs down your collective spines, for you all know the true dynamics of space combat: close enough for the scopes, close enough to strike.

But armed craft are rare…and even if they're pirates, you might have enough range to slip away…so long as they're not brandishing dual outriggers.

A distinctive five-tone signal chimes over the radio. Instantly, you all know what this means: Cove Stalkers.

Their radio sign has become a well-known jingle that drifters have come to fear - because even if they aren't warming up their railguns, they're undoubtedly eager to drag you through some kind of bullshit.

The Cove Stalkers are an infamous mercenary group that cut its teeth partnering with the Dugall Freight Company during the Freight Wars.

They've since become the go-to enforcers for Beshtalan corporations looking to secure their fragile claims on Fringeling space.

A distorted voice rasps over the radio:

"By the authority of Calson Wight, you are encroaching in private space. Quelch your burners, kips. We got you painted solid under company rails, so nothing greasy."

The thing about most Cove Stalkers you'll encounter is that they're incredibly bored. Despite the fearsome reputation they've garnered over the seasons, they've effectively gone corporate, turning once-lethal artisans of combat into idling guard dogs, propped up by a well-endowed armory.

Left to their own devices, they've become known for a tendency to shake down passing craft, bullying them into handing over loot, supplies, or simply inconveniencing them for their own amusement - all with the knowledge that engagement just means a bit of extra paperwork…and a single railshot will wipe away all witnesses.

For the more combat-ready crews, this severely limits your options for recourse and they know it. At least if they were pirates, you could assume that they'd want to keep your ship intact for requisition, but these guys don't give a fuck.

Parlay is the only path forward…or is it?

DIPLOMACY:

Looks like some of you have some friendly affiliations onboard. While Cove Stalkers are normally pretty indiscriminate with their application of coercion, the one thing they do fear is bad blood traveling up the chain to Beshtalan power brokers.

If any of your crew bear Beshtala-Chanko, Dugall Freight, League of Channel, Expatriation Roster, or Mercenary insignias, - with a little coaxing, the Cove Stalkers might be amenable to letting you pass through.

A few of you even have some former Cove Stalkers in tow, which is ultimately a free pass to a peaceful crossing.

After trading banter and a few disparaging remarks directed toward the bulk of drifterdom, some of you are on your way.

But for those who don't have the luxury of influence or camaraderie with these goons, other measures will have to be taken.

EVASION:

If diplomacy isn't your strong suit, perhaps you have a seasoned pilot in the chair. Those that bear the Topography Society, Longhaulers, Expeditionary Society, Slash Patcher, or - best of all - a Saddler Racing League insignia - might have what it takes to outmaneuver this standoff.

If successful, a double-roll and a cyclone dive, will juke your ship into their blind spot.

Even retired Saddler's tend to keep a can of reactor juice in pocket and a dash of sauce on the burners will have you speeding on your way, leaving a scope-jamming shockwave in your wake.

BARTER:

It's perhaps a bit of a longshot, but if a member of the Union of Merchants is in your crew, you can attempt to barter your way through.

RETREAT:

For the rest of you, or those that couldn't scrounge enough cachet to squeeze through the blockade…you're all forced to retreat, rerouting out of Cove Stalker jurisdiction.

THREATEN/AMBUSH:

It appears that a few of you, however, have a more aggressive option that no one else is quipt to attempt.

Several crews have brought with them the confidence of one or more Freight Wars EVA vets, quipt with Kickback Bombshot launchers.

While your pilot keeps the Stalkers preoccupied on the radio line, they silently slip out the airlock and glide between the Stalkers' twin Rackworms, safely out of the firing cone of their railguns.

Once in position you reveal your countermeasure. An easy lob from the bombshot presents an equalizing blow, turning this stickup into a stalemate of mutually assured destruction.

The Stalkers can hear the unhinged desperation in your threat as they realize that what was supposed to be easy pickings has turned into quite a scratchy encounter. They fold their hand, back down, and let you pass.

And finally, only one crew - Seishin of the Void - has got a secret weapon in their cabin. A Roving Terror pirate captain, quipt with a devastating coil gun and the EVA agility of a Halleyforge Jetpack.

There's no need to dabble with threats for this deadly drifter. The flare of their powerful suit-mounted thrusters immediately alerts the Cove Stalkers to the threat…but the encounter is effectively over already.

Too quick a target to paint, the pirate jets past the Rackworms and before the thought to pivot can translate into defensive action, two shots have already been fired from the coil gun, vaporizing the mercs in their seats as their exploding reactors consume their ships.

While some of you fared better than others, the Cove Stalker gauntlet has been crossed. Those who had to reroute have lost precious time and resource bandwidth. Those who were able to squeeze through and keep the route, remain better positioned to tackle the next obstacle: the long, dark of The Void.

Decacycles of empty space stand between you and your prize. You pray that your journey is mundane, but even mundanity has its own perils for a crew of five, pakt like sardines in a crushed tin box.

FOOD:

Next to air and shelter, food is everything. Staving hunger is merely the baseline for what food can offer. Bad food makes one more susceptible to health issues. Tedious or drab food will deteriorate morale over time. A healthy, varied diet is a boon on both fronts.

If you have graduates of the Borsh Conservatory of Gastrocraft or anyone proficient with a Machine Mouth, they'll serve you well on this journey.

MENTAL:

Staying sharp and of sound mind is an often underestimated trial of the void. There's no escape from the walls of your craft. No respite from your crewmates. When pressures mount, there's no release valve in this airtight cannister.

Those who bear the insignias of:
Forsaken
Bench
The Path
Transcendentalists
Void Drifter
Survivalist Guild
Free Fringe
…are well-versed in the mental marathon of the longhaul and can help their crewmates weather the psychological storm.

Toxic personalities, however, can infect the whole crew.

Those who brandish:
Combustible
Dark Ether House
Slash Patcher
League of Channel
Carver
Ji
…badges tend to deflect their inner turmoil with aggression and condescension, poisoning the fragile vibe.

MAINTENANCE:

Undoubtedly issues with the ship will arise on a journey this long and your crew's proficiency with maintenance determines how quickly problems can be resolved. Those with EVA skill and mech suits fare particularly well on this front, keeping exterior operations quick and safe. Additionally, the expertise of a member of the Cog Crew or Engineers Guild will keep your craft in working order.

NAVIGATION/SPEED:

Both of the previous considerations are also aided by a speedy, efficient route.

Members of the:
Saddler Racing League
Man Earlie Expeditionary Society
Longhaulers
Topography Society
Union of Merchants
…will keep your ship on track to your destination as quickly as possible.

LUCK:

And lastly, regardless of your preparations or expertise, a little luck can go a long way. The spirits of the Patron Saints of Decompression on the Margul Scavengers, of Air Supply on the Motley Wannabes, and of Sanity on the Saints of the Round Power give those crews an extra boost for a frictionless passage.

Finally, after enduring cycles on end, comes the sight every longhauling drifter yearns to see: a flickering speck in the distance.

The speck grows into a swirling green orb, revealing itself to be a tumultuous gas planet, roiling with electric storms. Your crew gathers around the cockpit glass to silently behold your long-awaited destination.

Despite the terrifying beauty of this unadulterated frontier planet, fear and disappointment begins to set in. No one dares say anything, but there's nothing on the scopes save for the ragged buzz of electrical radiation emanating from the planet itself.

But then, as your craft settles into orbit, arcing toward the planet's dark side, a barely perceptible rainbow glint catches your eye.

Hidden in low orbit amidst the spectral haze, floats the fabled craft: the ancient Surveyor Station.

You dive down toward it.

—

Even in its state of disrepair, battered by centuries of celestial wear, the station might just be the most beautiful thing you've ever seen…and that's not only because of the payload it represents.

Old World craftwork is a different breed. Organic in its design, full of flowing lines and intricate latticework, wrought of extinct materials forged with long-forgot methods - most notable of which: the Vellum Shale that pulled you out here.

The shimmering shale hangs like sailcloth, draped from numerous masts that reach out from the craft like the branching tendrils of treeroot. The cloth-like metal sheets curve in smooth folds and the multi-colored lightplay glistening across their surface almost makes them seem to ripple in the wind despite being frozen motionless in the vacuum of space.

As your craft settles into parallel orbit, your crew schemes its approach on how to best pillage the shale.

You'd expected to see debris damage, but it appears that some kind of explosion has burst open the side of the chassis from the inside, taking the airlock hatch with it. Ship-to-ship boarding isn't going to be an option.

As you continue your reconnoiter of the craft, you float past what appears to be the bridge. Through the impossibly large and still fully-intact windows, you can see that the interior has been pillaged.

It's clear others have been here before you.

All components have been gutted from the control panels, leaving behind the skeletal husk of what was once a super-advanced helm.

But reams of Shale still hang from the masts and this is all that matters.

Floatsuits are donned. Tools are prepped. Coils of hose stacked on their spools. It's time to get to work.

And so, the harvest begins. Using your ship as an EVA platform, you work your way through the labyrinth of masts and shale sheets.

You work as a team to unhook the sheets, trim them down, and roll them into neat reams for packing in your ship's cargo carriage.

The super-light and pliable V-Shale comes down relatively easily in zero-g, but it's tedious and time consuming work.

This is really a case of how suited and well-quipt your team is to conduct an efficient EVA operation.

Mechsuits, Hyperspec, and tools like grabbers, cutters, and bashers will aid your work. Orbital Mining experience and other EVA-savvy affiliations - everything from Grid Gangers to Slash Patchers - keep your crew running smooth.

Proponents of the Mesmegraph are particularly attuned to the engineering of this Old World craft and are able to exploit it with ease.

Spirits are flying high as your cargo carriage fills. All that remains is to keep it in pocket until you can swap it for cash back at the Bench…

But then one of your crew makes an intriguing discovery.

During the harvest, one of your crew drifts past the exploded hole in the side of the Surveryor Station. Succumbing to curiosity, they float closer to peer inside.

Just inside the hole, the space opens up into an expansive staging bay - a large internal hanger built to launch and receive smaller craft.

But there are no craft housed in its belly…instead you're greeted by a scene of absolute carnage, floating in zero-g.

Desiccated corpses - many of them missing limbs - and large globules of frozen blood hang suspended above the hangar floor.

At a glance, it's clear that these are not the original proprietors of the craft. This happened far more recently. These are fellow drifters,  most likely the compatriots of the drifter that spoke to Duzi.

It's clear some sort of scrape broke out, but less clear is the reason why. A dispute over payload allotment? An attempted mutiny of some kind?

But the how and why are the last things on your mind as you gaze upon the scene, for there is something far more captivating than the carnage itself.

Covering the entirety of the floor and beginning to creep up the hangar walls sprawls some kind of bioactive mold. The deep purple carpet pulses with intermittent bioluminescence, enough to softly illuminate the cavernous space with its rippling glow.

You move forward to get a closer look.

As you drift through the cloud of corpses, hanging inert like some kind of macabre art installation, you notice that several of them are fully consumed in the mold as well.

You also notice that the pulsing lights of the mold all seem to ripple forth from a single spot in the center. On closer inspection, the source is yet another dead drifter. Mold sprawls from her mud-caked body.

Your face contorts in puzzlement. Mud? Where'd these drifters find mud. But the thought is quickly wiped when you spot the bulging harvest sack strapped to her hip.

With the flick of your hunting knife, the sack is freed from its moldy casing and you peer inside to find a cache of brilliant blue bog pearls, each about the size of a fist, softly glowing.

Your eyes go wide with greed.

Kamrean bog pearls fetch a healthy price with Beshtalan jewelers, but those are amber and about half the size. These blue variants are surely something the market has never seen and will undoubtedly fetch a price commensurate with their rarity.

Invigorated by the surprise prospect, you make your way back to your ship and the rest of your crew…but not before prudently relieving the dead drifter of her chest-mounted nav module.

Back on your ship, the new findings are presented to the entire crew.

It appears the gas planet is not a gas planet at all, but hides a swampy surface beneath it's planet-wide storms. This is confirmed when the dead drifter's nav module is plugged into the ship's computer, indicating the precise coordinates of their landing site.

Debate swirls around the question of what to do with this information. You've already got a healthy amount of V-shale packed safe in the carriage. This is what you came for and you've succeeded with enough payload to more than make the trip worth it.

But on the other hand, a longhaul passage of this caliber is no easy feat and none of you are likely to ever drift through this deep frontier space ever again.

Standard bog pearls would be one thing, but this giant, blue variant is likely indigenous to this far-flung planet. Your harvest might be the only cache ever pulled and a quick dip down could effectively double your yield.

Ultimately, a consensus is achieved quickly. True leanmeat drifters that you are, you can't resist a tasty prospect.

The landing craft is prepped and your crew suits up for surface venture.

For a moment, fortune seems to favor the greedy as the eye of a continental hurricane hovers over the very spot you've got marked, making for a relatively easy descent.

Storms or no, atmospheric entry is never a peaceful thing. Even after you've racked scores of entries, the shake and rattle can make even the most seasoned of drifters' bones tremor with the flickering thought that this might be their last.

But despite the tumult, you pull through, trusting your scopes to lead you to the site.

Those who wear the Wings badge of atmospheric pilots are able to command the craft better than most and Topography Society members keep you on course, despite the chaotic weather.

As you break through the storm canopy, you notice a ship-wreck on the planet's surface - a landing craft, similar to your own, half-submerged in the muck and covered in purple mold.

This is a warning sign. Touchdown will not be possible in this swampy environ.

Then, a wild proposition comes from your pilot: Land atop the wrecked craft. Use it as a platform to weather the muck.

It's a risky maneuver, but you've come this far and you won't be swayed.

Slowly and carefully, your landing craft descends precisely atop the wreckage. It sets down off-kilter, but appears to be stable. You notice, however, that the weight of your craft is pushing the wreckage slowly deeper.

The race is on: harvest as much as you can before the runners of your sleigh get mired in the mud, trapping you here forever.

Your crew hastily debarks and sets to work.

With the toxic gas storms shrouding visibility and every movement requiring a toilsome slog through the muck, it begins to feel like this whole side quest might not have been worth it.

But then the first pearl comes to the surface, plucked from the ripe, fleshy stalks that sprout within the mud. And then another. And another…they're everywhere.

The site has proven to be bountiful and the ease of harvest wipes away some of the tension. Your crew pushes harder to milk their small window for all its worth.

High Tox, Deepsatch, and Subsurface mining veterans find the work familiar and harvest pearls quickly.

Anyone with a gastro background is attuned to the wild and the biological and finds they're particularly adept at sussing them out.

Hyperspec is also a big advantage in this low-viz environment.

Tools like the Ball Claw allow you to reach the deeper crevices and the Shriek antenna keeps comms clear in the storm, allowing for more effective coordination.

As the pearls keep coming, a giddy frantic energy swells amongst your crew. On top of the V-Shale haul, it's clear this is going to be a life-changing payout and it's difficult to not let the mind run wild with all the possibilities, fantasizing about the new ship or ships you're going to be able to purchase now.

But then, the radio crackles with a strange, barely intelligible message…

"Mutineers aloft. Come to the mouth of Grol the shit-mucker and feed our forsaken fury…"

At first, there's confusion. Your crew pauses their work, accusing one another of trolling the radio.

But then one of you notices a flicker of movement in the gas. Everyone stops and hushes, peering into the churning clouds…

There's nothing discernible until a flash of illumination beams through the haze…a spark…which in an instant grows into a small, candle-sized flame.

The small blaze flickers for half a second before it ERUPTS into an explosion of fire, tracing lines like spiderwebs through the gas. The chain reaction sweeps toward you, consuming your entire crew in a swirling inferno.

Fortunately the fire quickly dissipates as the gas burns off, sending the blaze burning upward in an arcing column, reaching toward the heavens.

Your crew frantically scans your surroundings for signs of the threat, but the churning gas makes visibility beyond a few meters impossible…though even those with hyperspec glass aren't picking up anything above the surface of the muck.

And when the hyperspecced finally turn their gaze downward, it's already too late.

Suddenly one of you is pulled into the muck, sucked into a scrappy grapple. The muck churns as a desperate fight for survival takes place beneath its surface.

The onlookers stand, weapons poised…hesitant to shoot or swipe lest they kill their crewmate, hesitant to enter the fray lest they become victims themselves.

Eventually your crewmate wrests free of the attack and rises above the surface of the mud, staggering back to catch their breath.

But the attacker rises just behind…a monstrous undulating heap. As it heaves itself forward, several more muddy figures join it.

They charge with frenzied momentum - and as the mud drips away it reveals the vague silhouette of a human - a Scaper helmet barely recognizable under the prongs of moldy growth that cover its whole body.

These must be survivors from the previous mission…greed-fueled mutineers fatefully left marooned. How they've survived so long in this torrential hellscape eludes explanation, but it's clearly taken a toll on their minds and bodies, as evidenced by their incessant drive forward.

They're unarmed, but they rush you anyway, clawing with their hands, powered by a fearlessness that feels inhuman.

With a sharp CRACK, the first shot wakes the rest of your crew from their daze. They watch as the mud-covered man crumples in a heap.

They're psychotically curdled, yes, but even as human's go, they're actually quite frail, inexplicably burning their last dregs of stored energy to attack your crew.

Well-armed crews instinctively open fire, unloading on the staggering horde - Koltsos and Carvers cracking away.

An explosive round from a roulette gun flings limbs in all directions, slapping back down to the surface in a cascade of thrown mud and flesh.

Instinctively, blades come out - if you have them - and whether by the satisfying sweep of the straight blade or the hard-earned chew of sharp teeth, mutineers are halved and quartered.

A fiery blast from a Cream Steamer is perhaps ill advised - triggering another sprawling chain reaction of combustion, but the thick layer of mud that now covers all of you, protects you from the burn.

For the rare few brandishing a death beam, the body-mounted capacitor can only flash for five ticks, but five ticks is more than enough time to turn biology into physics, atomizing muscle and bone alike and cutting a glassy line into the surface of the muck that stretches half a square long.

Even those only brandishing hooks and claws find it an easy task to cripple these emaciated fools.

…except for one crew…the Saints of the Round Power.

The Saints are crewed by four Freight Wars Vets brandishing identical bombshots. These weapons that proved so effective in the Cove Stalker showdown…were unfortunately too unwieldy to bring down onto this mucky surface.

After attempting to pluck a meager pearl harvest by hand, the vets are left as defenseless as their attackers. All they have working for them is the luck of their patron saint.

Some throw fists and one manages to crack a neck under heel, but it quickly becomes apparent that their efforts are better spent outrunning the psychotic fiends back to the lander.

—

Nothing visible remains of the shipwreck that served as your landing pad and just as your lander's runners are about to be consumed by the muck, the thrusters fire, sending a spray of clay and mud as the lander tears itself away from this cursed planet.

A terrible cacophony rattles through the whole ship as it rockets through the storms. Moments later, when the craft breaks through the atmosphere on a column of vapor, all goes quiet.

Your crew stews in silence, perhaps rattled more from the insanity on display than the violence itself.

As the scene replays in your heads, someone eventually cracks a smile. It's infectious and soon the thrill of the close call spreads through the rest of the group.

Sacks of pearls come out. Yields are compared. Wagers are settled. And celebratory bottles are passed around.

—

After breaching the storm, the cruise back to your ship is a smooth, silent breeze.

The lander docks. The suits are decontaminated. And the bevy of pearls joins the stacks of Vellum Shale in the cargo carriage.

The squares get punched and the thruster does a nice strong burn. You're home free…at least that's how it feels.

In reality, however, you picked up an undetected tail before you even reached the Surveyor Station. Pirates have been following you for several cycles now.

They painted your target, let you do the work, and have been lying in wait to purge the bloated belly of your post-mission ship.

But you don't know any of this until you hear the unmistakable THUNK of the spearhook plant itself in the side of your ship.

The flash of passing crotch-scooters outside your broadside portholes tip off that you've fallen into a Roving Terror trap.

The Roving Terror are perhaps the most fearsome and storied of the pirate groups that skulk The Fringe, known primarily for their uncanny ability to take down large freighters and tourist vessels with their large, organized fleets in the early days.

Now, they're a more scattered, ramshackle operation. They've been pushed out of hot spots by corpo-mercs and have scattered across the less-traveled routes where they lie in wait for enterprising drifters like yourselves.

Roving Terror boarding tactics are a well-honed machine. Tether lines flung from crotch scooters latch on either flank, allowing boarding raiders to slide down them to work the hatches, regardless of whatever inertial maneuvers your pilot might try to pull.

And even if you've got Roving Terror members on your crew, there's no platform for diplomacy here. A signature of a Terror raid is the radio jammers they deploy, blasting abrasive music over your ship's comms.

But if you've got pirates or former pirates in tow, what they can offer is intelligence. They know the routine and how to best combat it.

A pivotal distinction from your previous Cove Stalker encounter is that you can rest assured that the pirates want to keep your ship intact. It's just a matter of preventing them from taking over…

And ultimately, what these pirates don't necessarily anticipate is that - after the bullshit you endured on that muckhole of a planet - you're not gonna let this ship fall easy.

The finish line is in sight. It's ride or die now.

Any EVA-combat specialists on your crew leap to action, putting up a strong defensive front. The bombshots are back in business, picking off scooters before they can send their crabs down the line.

Mech suits facilitate spacewalk agility allowing you to go toe-to-toe with the parasitic attackers latching onto your chassis.

Hull-hooks are the perfect tool to sever cables and prod them away…and the advanced targeting system housed in the Trailmaker helmet paints floating targets with automated precision.

Some of you have enough defensive power to beat them back.

But other crews ultimately aren't quipt to thwart the boarding party and are forced to determine their fate indoors. And once the pirates get on board, the dynamics of the scrape fundamentally shift.

Blood and viscera can be cleaned. A breached hull cannot.

Blades and bludgeoning tools become the weapons of choice and the cramped interior of your ship becomes a wall-to-wall bloodbath.

Expecting a much more docile crew of explorers, the Roving Terror are taken off-guard by your payload-fueled fervor. There's too much at stake to allow your labors to be plucked from the sky and your crew expresses this with alarming brutality.

A drifter with a full cargo carriage is a dangerous beast and these pirates have chosen to tangle with a legendary haul.

Finally, with a satisfying kick, the last pirate is hurled out your airlock and sent spinning into the void as you clutch his graffiti-covered helmet. A trophy for your efforts.

The hatch slams shut and the intrusive music fades as you gun the thrusters, Benchward bound.

Exhausted from the battle, your crew collapses in relief, too tired to care that the walls have been painted with pirate blood.

All that matters is that the payload is safe.

Regardless of how you started this journey, everyone is now fast friends, bonded by your shared trials. Morale is high. Claustrophobic accommodations and depleted rations don't faze you.

You could eat nothing but everfuel bars for cycles on end at this point. The Vellum Shale and bog pearls cradled safely beneath your feet provide all the satisfaction you could ever need.

Eventually, the flickering lights of the Bench appear in the distance, a beacon of hope in the darkness. Your pilot cracks a smile and knowing looks are exchanged.

There's no need for words, not that any could express the utter relief and thrilling optimism you feel knowing how good that first mug is gonna taste when you return to the Sowing Season to regale Duzi with your success, pockets bulging with fresh cash.

THE END.
