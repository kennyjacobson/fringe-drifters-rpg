The Caddypack is pure box. What you see is what you get: heavy, simple, and solid. Three sizes. Adjustable frame. With the success of these boxpacks, Fringeling Outfitters Magkery contracted mass production with Ourbos, so now these packs are constructed in the same factory that fabricates airlock hatches. The implication holds true. These beasts are overbuilt. As the tales go, the Caddypack is so solid, Drifters have used them in a pinch to patch hull breaches and, as the legend goes, the Deaconcore crew once subsisted for decacycles in a Tox5 environ by welding a hut comprised purely of discarded Caddypacks.

## Hunchback

A bulkier alternative to Karrom's ubiquitous Scratchpack for the Drifter who needs some weather-sealed storage, but also boasts a penchant for some good old scraplashery. The stock-welded external frame extends beyond the brunt of the box to create ample space for webbing and mesh, expanding mess-storage capacities to obscene levels while still keeping your precious kit tidy and dry. While a scrapper may prefer the straight-chanting simplicity of a Scratchpack or other such net, Karrom's Haricrate is a favorite among prospectors and anyone who blends the arts and requires a cradle for both precision toolery and the messy load of indigenous harvest.

Tis a subject not oft chanted. Those first few years on Earlie Prime, all the sturp and droge was pinged on the powerball boom. But those who were bootprint awares remembers the other craze that was taking off: the Fringeling wet markets. Procurement of live, perishable goods to be sold back in BC. Gourd Burls was among the first wave of gastrotechs on Earlie Prime. A crew member on a basic supply hopper, Burls recognized the raw potential of the vast new canvas of fauna The Fringe had to offer. He spent his off duty hours wandering the outskirts of basecamp snatching up anything he could fit in his hooch. Getting product back to BC live and unspoilt, however, proved harder than expected and after several failed attempts Burls contacted a BC livestock specialist who supplied him with a Gerrick and Tonnerly temp-stable pressurized incubator (originally designed for hatching brolite larvae). The incubation system kept his product from succumbing to environmental fatigue during the ponderous journey back to BC. After several lucrative supply runs, Burls offered to buy out Gerrick and Tonnerly's entire incubation program. They declined, hoping instead to reap the rewards of the new business sector Burls himself helped forge. In short order, G&T created several new lines of incubators, purpose-built for Drifters heading into the fringe. For long-haulers in The Fringe, portable incubators (commonly referred to as gerry stows) have become essential gear for those working in hazardous areas where resupply is scarce and food must be stretched to that absolute limit.

## Poacher Pots

While trapping and hunting were the initially the chief industrial methods for interacting with the wild new swath of Fringeling fauna, the rife market for live capture gussied its peck shortly thereafter. It started with them gastrotechs wanting for fresh morsels, the wildest and weirdest of which seemed to find their way out into The Fringe. And then the exotic collectors of BC's moneyed dementia started skimming critters and needed means of transport. Gerrick & Tonerly were already fabricating industrial-grade incubation systems for brolite larvae and were quick to pounce on some new Fringeling business. The Pack Menagerie is just one of their frontier-capable products designed to keep live wares as such for the duration of their journey to their new masters...but only just. This is NOT an incubator, despite the manufacturer's heritage. Biome canisters are capable of sealing and seeding, but the slides are much more crude than a full incubation system would offer. Thus enters the cryptic craft of pot poaching. Only the magicians among the class have been able to husband their bounty with any reasonable rate of success, using backwoods chem to approximate the living conditions of the species' native biome. But a successful journey yields high reward among the pet collectors back home, making the venture an appealing one to many, despite it's high skill threshold.

The Squirrel Pack is a straightshot utility pack for most any Fringeling explorer, from the creaseless novice to the weathered veteran. Affordable, versatile, and rugged, there's pos no better value nor more available pack on the market. BC-native Squirrel Common Outfitters were among the first expeditionary manufacturers to establish a presence in The Fringe and their packs and suits are easily quipt at any first or second-use depot. The Squirrel pack features a common external frame, cavernous main upper, built-in tarp, and integrated breather tube. Modular racking means infinitely expandable and customizable orientations from a variety of aftermarket or bespoke additions be they gear pouches or vacuum tubes. The depth of customizability has catalyzed it's own cottage industry of enterprising fabricators hawking ready-to-drop Squirrel Pack sets, specifically configured for common destinations, environs, and industrial use-cases. Peruse any sling port for a variety of options.

On a planet with a spectrum of fog environs, like Earlie Prime's Haze and Veil, the chem specs can and most absolutely do vary valley to valley and square to square. While BC ecological diversity has long been a ghost of what it once was, The Fringe still makes rich soil for a prehistoric breadth of floral species and subspecies, seemingly crafted bespoke for the whole of the minutiae of ecological circumstance within which they're tasked to make life. This makes the propagation of such species incredibly difficult, nigh impossible. And while many buck any sort of off-world husbandry, the Fringe is ripe with unique floral properties, be they nutritional, medicinal, or chemically capable in some other fashion. But in order to elucidate such properties, the specimen must be picked and prodded in a laboratory setting. Enter the G&T's Florapack, a preservation device capable of excising a fragment of the entire ecosystem necessary to keep an indigenous specimen alive - everything from gas to soil. While intended to be used primarily by research chemists, the packs have found popularity among the more well-endowed and aspirational of the gastrotech class as well.

## The Sink

Canner's Pipepack was originally intended as a spacewalk breather. While nowaways it barks as a bit of an antiquated design - bulky and overwrought compared to the sleeker tanks of late - it still confidently serves that purpose, capable of cocktailing whatever gas mix the user requires. But it's the wont of The Fringe to curry any and all viable use cases from limited and precious kit and so, The Sink has taken on new life in the gastrotech scene. With some clever rerouting and patchwork mods, gastrotechs have transformed this old hunk into a mobile distillery for ingredients, alcohol, and medicinal tinctures. Of particular use on expeditionary crews, this pack can become something of a mobile ingredient factory for all manner of vinegars, oils, and other consumable solutions. If gastro is your intended purpose, however, be sure to check any greymarket finds for residual irradiation from spaceflight.

The P40 Survivalist is just about the creamiest you can get when it comes to expedition-grade packery. Calson Wight has a long heritage of BC-made quality and have quipt some of the most legendary crews going back well before the first forays into The Fringe. The P40 stands proudly as their latest iteration of a cure-all survival pack. Don't let the relatively slim profile deceive you, this piece was thoughtfully designed to measure most any task save for the bulk-bound scrapper. Adjustable organization to compress gear into it's ample discreet storage. Full compatibility with most any hosed bob and built-in temp and pressure controlled canisters to serve as anything from gas reserves to protection for perishables. But fair warning, anyone flashing Calson Wight wares out in The Fringe makes themselves a pop for pelfgrubbers. Shiny kit means shiny coffers in the minds of the dredges, so when you spring for the best, just make sure you've got the heft to protect your assets.

Tis a simple affair, but simple means dependable. The welds ain't pretty, but Karrom makes them strong as sleds. A favorite of scrappers for obvious reasons. Mesh bends to the shape of any quarry. But scrapper or not, the Forager Scratchpack is a dirty-job staple for any gig that calls for the messy or obtuse, getting your stuff - whatever it may be - off the ground and on your back with confidence.

Though Murley crafted this pack to be the seamless companion of their famed industrial bobs, it's easily adapted to fit most any cut of breather. With gas tanks and filtration systems fully integrated into the hardshell design, the RP-100 is ready to feed oxy with confidence under the threat of near any industrial-grade pressure or battery. Whether your job takes you floating in the great vacuum or into the hazy tox of some frontier jungle, this pack'll take a beating and get you out with calm swigs all the way. Though Murley's revered rigidity offers a hard-working carapace, it's worth noting that the there are concessions made in packability. Storage is meager and inflexible. But for most any brunt-wielding strapper, it'll be enough to keep you drifting smoothly.

For closed-circuit breathers, look no further than Rembly, a one-trick Fringeling manufacturer that slaps composites as good as any heritage BC brand. They've perfected the art of the breathing tank over generations of iterations to arrive at the latest offering in their focused catalog. Compact and lightweight, this backtank is as ready for rugged gas-tox environs as it is for floaters. And it's the weight that sets this particular pack apart from the rest of the float-centric designs where mass is a concern often treated more trivial than colorway. The only consideration is that your gas is gonna need to be pre-mixed. To keep a sleek profile, Rembly tossed out the kitchen. There's no field cocktailing to be had here. But who mixes their own gas nowaways anyhow?
