**Author:** Fancy Karl

Korkheads still at it? Always felt those League of Kork fellows were a bit curdled, but reckon you gotta be to do what they did. This was early Fringe, afore Man Earlie even laid eyes on his first powerball. A new way of life for a new world was their whole gimmick. Don't remember what exactly they was on about, but pos some form of utopian mirage. But cake honored where cake earned, they were some industrious little cultists, a longstake from those Margul rascals of late. Entirely self-sufficient down to the fab of all their kit. Hadtuv been some healthy coin behind the whole venture. Went deep into the outer Fringe to start their settlement, far away from BC as they could get. Much as I know, no one's heard pip from them since, but you still see the odd Korkhead drifting through The Bench. Don't know if they true or if they just a scrapper who picked the pieces, but who knows? Maybe they got a whole metropolis humming out there in the void and we're the ones who are curdled.

## Deathshead

![Deathshead](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r125.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

A skull over a head. That doesn't work at all, my dear Padulweis, unless some small-framed clan predates their large-skulled enemies. Heads are not cups that can be stacked inside of each other, however much you boil away the soft tissues. A nonsense possibility. Mine humble theory is more sensible: these fearsome visages were designed for the smaller heads of children, who would wear them until maturity, when one might graduate to the helmets, masks, and headdresses worn for hunting and warfare. This explains, also, the heavy filters to protect their little alveoli from the panlunar dust, pollen, and spores. For little lungs, large filters. The children are the future, so they wear the dead. But I hear you saying, "Ah, your humble theory does not yet explain that these masks are also found on the anatomically mature Hesh adults." Clever, but not so clever as my provisional hypothesis. The mature beings found in these deaths-head dominos are, psychically, stuck in adolescence. You might know some such persons, Padulweis. I jest. Or, perhaps, they are interlopers appropriating a culture and tradition in profound ignorance. Perhaps you know some such persons, Padulweis. And, this time, I do not jest.

## Soup Gagers

![Soup Gagers](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r126.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Soup divers make crusty fellows and by crusty I mean in the literal sense with all that residual piff cracking every crevice with toxy chalk. But the crust bleeds not into temperament. Cross all my scrapes, I've found the soupy among us to be some of the jolliest fellows around. Don't know why. You'd spect the goggle-eyed creeps to smack a little stankier as tends to be the wont throughout the rest of the high-tox scene, but the Drifters wading through the swamps just hit different. Maybe it's got something to do with the fluid breathers they use. Praps they tidy just that bit more grit, keeping the airways fresh and the brain-blood clean. Or praps it's the viscosity of their native environs. A soft blanket of thick air offers quiet comfort, damping harsh noises and moods and breeding a creamier sort of Drifter. Fuck do I know? Pos didn't come here to read prattle, so I'll not dive my chant below reason any longer. Fact is this bob is light on the neck and doesn't warrant soup to be useful. Filters good as the rest, so don't sleep on a solid specimen of toxic lightwear just cause you ain't got a hunger for the swamps. And who knows...maybe there's something in the fluid that lightens the mood. There's far too few optimists in The Fringe and if there be some chem magic in this bob, worth a swing I reckon.

## BC Shiner

![BC Shiner](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r102.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Many a drifter caught squinting at BC-made expo-wares and it true there be cramps of factory spew only suitable for excursionists and toys. But Calson Wight ain't no cutrate hawker and in my book, to pan the original outfitters is to embrace one's own ignorance on the matter. Calson quipt the Teardrop Crew way back in the day when they forged the Central Waterworks Line. Calson quipt all the first-gen Saddler roid-racing teams. the Blackcap insurrectionists all had Calson badges on their bobs when they seiged Grace Hall. This is starting to sound like an advert, but such is fact and heritage is real. The latest Calson drops are far flung from the cast boxes the Teardrops wore, but they still cut crystal like no one else can. This bob comes pakt with integrated rebreathers for long-haul stints. True of all Calson crystal, the dome will sheen like nothing else and that sweet sweet clarity pumps performance and bucks fatigue. You think it's no shake, but then you try it and your mindplate shifts a tick and then nothing scratches the same again. A shiny bob for a shiny drifter. No doubt it'll put a target on your head though so tread carefully. Screams fancy and these premium Calson bobs have become something of a flag as the bearer is more oft than not a corpo steward or some trussed-up prong with a misguided frontier fetish. Don't mean it don't work though and Calson always works harder than most. And their glass is no joke.

## Kano Headdress

![Kano Headdress](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r172.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

I seen these only once in my life. Ran into a posse of these headdresses while humping sweetglass for this smuggling outfit back when I was a young scrapper game for any grub I could snag. Real haggard crew they was. The smugglers, that is. Had to pit on some wilderness intermoon to reem our outrigger. Don't remember the moon's name or if it even had a name. Just remember it was red and even with CAT3 filters, the air in my bob tasted like cap juice. Tingly. Four of these figures emerged from the chalk, leering all stoic like. My skipper made chant of old Kano tech. Said they was multi-planar. Could see into the soul layer. Feels speculative and in my time these sort of notions haven't found much purchase, but clear as, I can't scratch that the whole encounter felt spiritual, whatever that means. They drifted on, no comms exchanged. Perhaps 'cause they had no need for such a primitive mode of interface. Regardless, they walked like they had bigger pots to tap and needn't give so much as a fart for some darkside grub humpers. Everyone knows the legend of the Holy Predator and Queen Chanko and if the story holds, means the Kano line ended with him. So far as I know these were just some sulky scrappers who dug some old bobs out of the dirt.

## Good King Maude

![Good King Maude](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r170.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

The go-to float bob if you're no longer in the business of throwaways. Murley's flagship. Standard issue for any mining outfit with requisite salt and worthwhile intent. Mostly for floaters, but plenty a trunkneck walks surface in these with no trouble. Don't know what else you want me to say. It's a good box. Murley makes 'em rigid. Nothing funny, nothing fancy. Mandible mounts come standard with beams, but swappable with the deepest mod scene in the space. Tweeters. Beam cutters. There's even an aftermarket rebreather kit. When everything kicked off on Earlie after the Hotel Gullard spat, everyone at Round Power - from pit-fuckers to pilots - started toting metal. Buncha the roid boys mounted pit shooters to their faces with this system, which was a wild sight at first, but by the end, became standard practice on both sides with all them EVA raids. War begets innovation, I reckon. Always has.

## Hangtooth

![Hangtooth](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r171.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Yet another classic piece from Murley. They know how to hit 'em hard. Heavy-tox ready with twin filtration tusks, external cage for that extra scrabble, and UA mounts for complete modularity, this beast will take you confident into the gnarliest of tracts. Takes a beast of equal steel to bear this burden, though. Not for the twangly or timid. A favorite of deep-tox miners and the rowdiest of survival guides alike. This bob bears no kips or pretenders as only the leanest of meat can handle the heft and no one wants to paint themselves an easy target by staggering dumb, top heavy with pro-grade Murley Box. This bob makes you earn your keep within it's crystal fortress.

## Baghead

![Baghead](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r162.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Bakka Filk started stitching together these low-rent bag bobs from the scrap fabric of their similarly low-rent line of suits. Now don't point me any trusses, they'll get the job done if you lack the means for some proper crystal, but they ain't gonna last more than a hayseason afore the seam seep starts to finger your nostrils so I don't recommend these bags as any sorta endall. Stuff one in the pouch as a hedge against glasscrack, sure. But aside from the pitiable poor or senseless kip, the only coves you'll see bobbing in bagheads are likely to be pelfgrubbers, so keep your pockets clipped.

## Yawper

![Yawper](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r122.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

Snaps! I take up my stylus and put it down, tempted once again by the satisfying buttons. I remove the nose piece, and then clasp it back into place. I remove the strap that holds in the mouth box - a clever machine that filters noxious fumes while also amplifying the voice. A wonderful asset for the colliers beset with noise or bedeviled by interference on their channels. One feels the voice of a prophet when expelling trite instructions through these boxes. "Cast thy shovel on the other side of the lode" - inane direction in one's own voice; vatic poesie when amplified through the box. More snapping. Wonderful action through the old fingerpads. The lenses, too, are modular. Shade in the glare of the alien stars or the spark of a welding torch; clear in the dim caverns of the planet; carved and cut to supplement those who cannot see beyond the point of their drill or those who, through the fault of only their own eyes, cannot liter-ate. My dear Padulweis, I would not know what to do if I could no longer read your missives and if thine eyes could no longer read mine. Snaps while I observe the remaining structures. The empty snaps on the side of the mask indicate an absent hood of some sort. The wiry knob on the forehead, mysterious. Best left alone. Best left alone. Best left alone. Best left alone. Best left...

## Shutters

![Shutters](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r123.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

A theory of the mask - all masks: obj. of imitation, mimicry, mayhap even metonymy. No, not at all about concealment. Revealing the world - apocalypse on the face, because the face is so deceptive and ephemeral, now smiling, now grimacing, now disgusted in obedience to the olfactory organ that has encountered some rank bodily atmosphere, proximate. The Fringe perspires. Against entropy, the mask, my dear Padulweis. But I can hear you already - perceptive as always! - doubting this theory as a friend doubts a friend. You only want and want only the best for me. So look closer. The shuttered eyes and mouth, mirroring the shutters of the Lighthouse. Closed off, the world is dark and so is the face. A simple metaphor from a simple cult that all wear the same domino when they worship their beacon. I cannot imagine you prostrate before a hole in the ground, Padulweis, or any hole anywhere, and nor can mine self. But let's not make this about libido. An obelisk next to a maw. I shudder! The metaphors are too easy, and Tupper "the Younger" is proof that one only needs one simple metaphor to build a faith.

## Sock

![Sock](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r161.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

My advice? Cover your biscuit if you see this sack coming. More bag than bob, this softshell scans as a sure mark of a pelfgrubber. Pos not a fair read, but it's a cautious read and my paps always said that the flash only finds you if you ain't looking. Could always be a family man or marm under the skin. Maybe it's all some wholesome toadfarmer could rummage. But in all my trips, I ain't never seen no one frosting one of these sackheads but pelfgrubbers and miscreants. Known to have issues with seam seepage so don't be surprised if the bearer got a slimy cough.

## The Hoodie

![The Hoodie](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r101.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Ain't nothing wrong with a softback so long as the stitching is good. Backword is that the stitching on these done by those Purin kids caulked up in the factory squares of the Besthalan Flats. Whatever your take on Purin labor, ain't nobody can scratch that those kids can't lash a good seam with those tiny, torqueful fingers. What more can I say? Ain't gonna let you float, but this bob will match most any surface scrape, wet or dry. And at a price more than fair, especially for BC-made wares.

## The Scaper

![The Scaper](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r166.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Ha! This bob a rife one. A deepsatch growler of the highest order. The first and only true squeezebox, I reckon. Commissioned by The Scapers they say. Real drifter leanmeat they was. Deepsatch miners with that oldstyle fringe-borne grit. They was trying to drop into Ruskam Gap to harvest that premium biofilm (the kind that fuels those SKX longhaul navitimers) and needed a bob that could task those pressures. Gofer was just a couple bros with a scratch shop on Earlie Prime at the time and this custom bobber for The Scapers would be their ticket to big-time expeditioncraft. Real creamy workmanship from those Gofer boys, especially afore they bulked up. Anyways, The Scapers gutted the Gap, brokebent as they were, and the growler served them well. Nowaways though, you see some kip frosting this bob, more likely he a pirate than a deepsatch vet. Costumed impressionists who've never felt a squeeze, just like the look cause they think it make them look scary like a harpclaw or something. Waste of a true specimen. Used to be you had to earn your keep rightaways, but such is the way of the fringe ever since Dugall opened the gates to any old cove.

## The Stalker

![The Stalker](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r168.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Fowes Trent is a trussed-up mutineer that thinks he can peer genteel with the BC crowd now that he's purplized his made-up legend through his incessant volumes of soft-cover fiction that prance as otherwise. The Cove Stalkers - his rag-tag band o' mercs - are a bunch of payday goons with candy coffers gilded in corpo-coin. Funny money. All they done is cramp a handful of dumb kips in backspace. Lest I get alleywayed in the night, a modicum of respect is due for the lethality of the arsenal they've become. The Cove Stalkers are indeed a formidable crew by virtue of sheer numbers and caliber of kit, but money has always been a shortcut to stature and the Cove Stalker name is built more on commercial success and good chant than heroics or any other such grit. I can understand if this whiffs of jealousy, but don't be misconceived. Let the Stalkers play as they may, I care not. It just irks me that the Stalkers insist on planting their name on everything when Jannes Gofer designed this bob spec for the Holy Forks. After the Gofer bros split, Jannes shacked up a new outfit as Pendulum and this piece was their flagship. Premium build quality. Lightweight as ever. First true hybrid, I reckon, fully capable float and surface. The distinguishing feature was the sonic readout in the crystal, designed specifically for the Holy Forks to track and hunt Potter Beetles. Thing is, it also made these bobs ace in combat. Jannes was always a peaceable fellow, so I know he lives to resent the military association. Fowes Trent was just some corporate grounder pounder for Bogram when he and his crew mutinied the whole dig for some reason or other. That taste of grandeur spawned the Cove Stalkers and with bloated pockets, they bought up the tastiest bobs they could find, hence the signature. Ah well. Guess I can't fault any drifter for rustling some cash. Cause that's what he is no matter how much he feigns otherwise...a drifter.

## Boxhead

![Boxhead](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r165.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Fucking boxheads. The sight of these abominations still makes me rattle. Starsight built these as a ticket to prance their new compact hyperspec optics. Same fidelity as their ship systems, but packed into a bob. But did any of those kooks stop to think about what happens to human matter when you beam hyperrays straightshot? No chantcraft, the scratches are tasty, lending hyperspectral perception in all manner of zero-viz environs. Chalk, haze, cistern, puredark. Doesn't matter, these bobs will give you purview. Upstart jelly-mining outfit Deaconcore snapped up the first run to kick off their ops in the Jocum Haze Caves, but it was only a matter of decacycles afore their miners started going wild. They say the eye taps straight to the soul, so I reckon it's not too windy to presume that the right shade of light through the aperture could tarnish one's essence, but I don't know much of such things and claim no cake in that regard. But when it comes to the Freight Wars, I'll take my cake. Some minstrel at Dugall reckoned these Starsight bobs would be ace in combat and I tell you what, the mercs frosting these boxes were the nastiest milkfuckers I ever painted. Animals. I spose once you go hyper in the brain, it be hard to come back. Not ashamed to say I'm too scared to try. Dabble with caution.

## Dohead (Pejorative)

![Dohead (Pejorative)](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r173.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

Alien grass, or hairy skeins exuded from animal scalp, or yarny threads crafted by Dofun weavers. My dear Padulweis, you are the only bosom friend that could weave with me on this moon or the next. Whatever the make, a glass case in the gallery to protect the organic matter of this mask from the chiggering dermestids and ravenous mites that seek to eat the cosmos into dust and casings. And a warm orange lamp, for the warm fibres of the mask. Or is it a cold light that we need instead, Padulweis? Optics never were my strength. Necessary also - a plaque beneath the case to explain the Dofun, who will explain nothing to the rest of us about the skeins, or the horn-mounds tied with dark threads. Primitive superstitions from primitive thinking - that is as much explanation as I need, Padulweis. As if eldritch lunar ghul tremble at colored string. The feeding tube, coated in some milky residue, speaks for itself. Remember the violence of the Dofun septs. Every freighter they find, they dismantle and burn. Conflagration. Inferno. Boiling flesh and scorched goods and twisted metals and the wail of stranded drifters. Ward the freight.

## Backstab Squeezebox

![Backstab Squeezebox](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r167.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

A tragic design, though by no fault of the Gofer boys. Coulda been a stalwart. Twas their first (and last) play into broadmarket appeal, taking all the merit of their spec pieces and packaging it right for volume production and a tasty price point. Versatility was the aim, with squeezebox rigidity in a compact form factor, rad insulation built stock, and swappable visors for a whole bream of use cases. Coulda been a hot market wot these dropped nowaways, but Gofer sealed the weld right on the prick of the Freight Wars. Fast as capflash, Earlie scooped up the first run to pot all his mercy boys. Everyone knew Gofer was right rigid, the local pride and peak of Fringeling engineering. But these bobs aint fight bobs and they never was intended to be. Reckon y'all heard of the Battle of Hazelands? More of a massacre than a battle. A fistfull of Dugall stalkers was all it took to wipe two full scuds of mercy boys off the face of Earlie Prime. Couldn't see for shit with these blinders for bobs. Some say the only cap-fire was from death shakes. Those stalkers could just creep through the haze and quietly poke a hole in the back of every unsuspecting kipper, daisy-chaining kills until the whole crew was cramped for good. The residual guilt over the matter left the once-prolific Gofer bros inept and the workshop disbanded. Shame all around.

## Rustler's Braincage

![Rustler's Braincage](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r169.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

The Rustler's Braincage. Good, sturdy, bulkbuilt eva bob. Bit too much of a neckbreaker for my taste if you mix in any grav, but as a floater, it's a real hard worker. Back in the day (afore the asset protection posses had skiffs), if you had cause to be cruising anywhere near the Rocky Cloud roid fields, you'd see swarms of rustlers, all wearing these cage bobs. Good brace against rockspray, obviously. Nice thick bars with room to bend afore glass crack. Made itself a legend among roid rustlers back in the playdays when any kip with access to a rig could poach ore til slacktime. Now that Murley ain't making them anymore, they become something of a rare find, sure to be posted with garish prices by any shopfaker that stumbles onto one. Overexcitment if you ask me. It's a good bob, but only good at factory price. Not in this market where every eager kip thinks they can prove their mettle by wearing a cage.

## The Clincher

![The Clincher](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r124.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

I confess I find little delight in the stare of this mask. An intuitive response. Is it groundless? Inquire. Mine eyes turn to the mouth. The bars are like so many little teeth, though they are not teeth at all but guard the delicate breathing filters. Is it true, also, that mine own little teeth - sadly diminished through long toil and strain in these hinterlands - also guard something within? I have thought of them, my whole life, as simple tools for grinding, shredding, tearing. Discomfiting to not know mine own teeth and their physio functions. Yes, the mouth is threatening but not because the "teeth" seek to grind my flesh. Look rather to the eyes. The glass is tinted to prevent the cataracts that arrive so soon in these exposed climes and diminished atmospheres. But the effect is to make the eyes look closed. There it is, Padulweis! The open mouth, the closed eyes - what is this? This is the face of a laughing man. One man o' mirth. That is the "everyman" of the Vay's so-called "classless-spirit." He respects naught. He laughs, thinking that our little museum will be naught, will be no be more than another frontier phantasm. Balderwock!

## Puffy Face

**Author:** Fancy Karl

Channelcraft stitches kit for all sorts, but where they excel is in the not-so-dark arts of insulation. The icy wasteland of Cester Fraesh comes to mind. You want soft bodies and thick layers when kitting for any sort of freeze and Channelcraft's textile prowess is the first place I'd look for such a venture. Haven't gone cold much myself. Don't think my toes could take the pinch. So don't look to me for any such cake, but all the fabbers like to flaunt any sort of field-earned cream and Channelcraft ain't gonna let you glance at a Puffy Face without chanting heavy on their place atop Faulk's head when he ran that ice creeper through the asshole. Bit tiresome, but seems solid enough an endorsement for me. But I ain't no expert.

## The Channelrat

![The Channelrat](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r127.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Warmax's update to The Wozer, their first comtox mask offering. Features the same tox protection, but with increased comm range and a lighter build overall. Given these hit the market just past peak conflict - when Earlie's rustler-mercs were really going to town with the float jobs and Dugall started taking the fight to the surface in earnest - methinks it was, at least in part, a combat play. If you wanna siege a settlement, you gotta at least try to make a pinch of it, and that means coordination across squares of who knows what sorta terrain interference. Regardless, still a go-to bob for sector digs or any such comm-heavy operation. Of late, I been seeing them a lot on the real lonely drifter types. Solo rovers, scrappers and scavengers, bottle collectors, and the like. Pos to chant wares to any passing crew, but I reckon I'd get yearny for some patter, drifting all by myself for decacycles on end. So wouldn't stir me up if them rovers like to channel surf or whisper mischief into unsuspecting tinners. I know I would.

## Astromask

![Astromask](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r174.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

Mesh wiring, providing much digital pleasantry when touched and stroked. Filter beneath - a touching recognition of corporea limitation. Drooping, leathery cowl attached by bespoke snapping button at the temple. The stonetrimmer in my chambers promises that this faceless covering was purloined from the astromancer Yat-yat, a genuine practitioner of the gramarye. Incubus or succubus? I trust your taxonomical discretion, my dear Padulweis, but do I trust the stonetrimmer? He sweats when he talks, and when I do not. And also when he does not talk, and when I do. Discomfiting. I do not perspire, as much as I can control that human fluid. Perhaps he has the stench, the beady skin-juice on the upper and lower lips, because he tells the truth and already imagines Yat-yat's visitation to the pathetic stonetrimmers' longhouse, walking between the bunks, seeking the thief who sold that mask and who Yat-yat might still visit with untold torments of the flesh and mind. Or does he dab and kerchief his forehead because - no! Because it is not at all the true thing but a clever imitation designed to fool, and make fool myself. Padulweis, I write as if I have not made decision or judgment - as if now is not yet then - when I have already become executioner and gravedigger and smuggler of mystical facewears.

## Gloamwight

![Gloamwight](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r128.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

My dear Padulweis, I weary of the atavism of these outer moons, stars, and planets. For strength, wear a hardy set of horns and antlers over the brain gourd. In the cold, wear animal fur to preserve the thermal properties. To thrive, mimic the native fauna of the alien moon. Or perhaps it is a zoomorphistic fallacy. Explore this. No, Padulweis. You cannot see me but I put down my stencil and paced my chambers and then, my thinking in the same circles as my feet, I take a different path out the door - locked behind me, never fear - past the barracks and mineral exchange and the churning lipid vats. I pause on the footbridge over the slough, and wonder at the rainbow slicks. They do not welcome me any longer at Chirpy's Canteen. Oh, no. How will my frame sustain without bowls of starchy gorsoup? Their water, so close to the slough, should not be trusted anyway. All purifiers in this frontier are clogged with heavy metals and noxious spores. There are other canteens and other gorsoups, less starchy, that I drank from the bowl (local custom) as I think about the zoomorphistic fallacy. But there were no breakthroughs, Padulweis. Only the harsh chords of a young drifter's stringed instrument. It is needful of tuning, as is this whole settlement. So we return to atavism as I return to my chambers. I am here now. I have my stencil, and that is how you can read my thoughts from so far away. We are present together in time, if not in space. I look again at the Gloamwight mask and I see it for what it is: a hybrid creature produced from the salvaged remains. The skull from a real living thing - a gloam. The coarse pelt from another beast that I have not yet taxonomized. (The fibers fall at such a rate that I worry it will be but a sore specimen for our little gallery.) The horns, long and short, the excreta of a crude lathe. All screwed and glued and bound together over a padded metallic frame that sits heavy but comfortable. Not atavism at all. A new mutation, and better than the sweaty troglodytitic mutants at Chirpy's.

## Darksight

**Author:** Perse, the Conservator

Cascading jowls, plaited. Beastly fangs sewn into a mouth. Or is it a mustachio, my dear Padulweis? Three ridges of animal fiber over the pate. On this luna incognita, who could wot the provenance of the organico-mechanico visage? But wot I did! The Hesh are, naturally or unnaturally, susp. of the stranger and traveler, with little sympathetico for the curious interloper. It was meet, then, that I assume the disguise of a lipid monger to crawl through the flapping entrances to their burrows and strike a bargain. A cask of regem butter for a mask - a cask for a mask, Padulweis!! - and a place on the hunt. The Hesh, like the beasts whose pelts they don and whose musks they smear upon their skin, are crepuscular. Energetic at nightfall and nightrise, hunting the hunter, tracking the loping cagweir by its loggy turds and the screeching panic of its prey. And I too wore the Darksight, which opened my old eyes to the thermal properties of this moon - the heat of the cagweir and the Hesh, who were little patient when I stared at the heat of mine own body through the mask. And I too saw the heat depart from the doomed cagweir that we encircled in our snares - though its face ensorcelled me. And I too feel colder now that the mask is in a cask for our little gallery. Mine own body looks colder now, and stranger for my time with the Hesh.

## Kipper

![Kipper](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r103.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fancy Karl

Brings me back. Used to be most every drifter, whether floater or dirtgrub, came quipt in a classic Calson Wight helmet. Can't beat the all-around of a good ole round hardshell. But as the niches bloomed and the fashions slid toward the professional, you started seeing less and less basic bobs in the space. Whether or not every fresh kip actually needs industrial kit or otherwise, I reckon no one wants to be branded a tourist. Makes you a hard mark pretty much anywheres, but optics aside, this is as good or better than most when it comes to hard-working versatility in The Fringe and I ladle my respect on those not ashamed to favor function and good build quality.

## The Wozer

Basic tox protection paired with long-range comms. Not gonna save your matter from sizzling in any high-rad environ, but radio ain't gonna fly clean in that kinda gas either. These wozer-mugged bobs often seen on crews with chanters, squad-based ops, or sector mining digs. A good tool for tox-work that requires any form of geographic coordination, really. Never slid my case into one of these hardsocks, but I reckon the viz ain't too creamy. Crystal muddles range though, so that's pos why they gone gridfilm with the eyes.

Ah, good ole Hoppy. Shame the outfit got done like they did. In all my cycles across generations of company kit, only fabbers I crossed that could shim a seal close enough to bump bellies with Hoppy workmanship was those Gofer brothers and they fell fate to similar collapse. True artists, I reckon. Rare talent seems to beget an outsized capacity for self-destruction and if the Currents be sentient, they've got cruel humors. The Spyhopper has to be the creamiest of Hoppy's former offerings and the goods were bashed so stolid it's still somewhat easy to pull a pristine specimen seasons after their retirement. Not all are quick to see the beauty in the Spyhopper's countenance. Tis a cultivated taste, I reckon, seasoned from face-to-face experience. Cuz this bob be the comfiest, coziest bob I ever locked in ring and that holds true for the long-float. These were made with endurance in mind and you can stay inside forever. Limited crystal may seem like a dent to the casual quipper, but for the rugged industrialist, peripherals are overrated and peepers keep the slime at bay and the seals gummy. And they don't stink! Strain on the chisel for cycles on end and your bob still be doling huffs fresh as running water. Don't know how they did it. Apparently no one does. And praps no one ever will again. Shame, I say again. Reckon that's the tacks when all your cards are stacked in a single deck. A little drink and too much appetite on the production line can ripple down the chain and whip itself into disaster. Some would say massacre.

Ye that dons the Pillowcase, labors in excess for kith and glamor. Don't mistake my chant, it's a good bobber. Quality by the clip from the choir of two stalwarts. The best in their respective games. Calson Wight in old school outfits and Channelcraft in magic textiles. And they blend beautifully to make an upper crisp, hard-use bob for long tenures in cold space. It's the market that brings the nonsense, as it so often does. These things cost enough to grease your steed with a shiny cockpit module, but all you get is one for your head. A favorite of those who know what for and play craft with valor, but their aptitudes have found them fortune enough times to wanna show it.

## Headforge

Canner Machine built this box to be indestructible. Crystal slats, heavy metal, and padded facets make it a fortress against rockspray and hardsmack. A haven for any with designs to desecrate all manner of floating rock. It's no wonder it became the headpiece of choice for the baddest posse of rustlers the Fringe has ever known. While the Headforger name echoes in the stars, what most don't know are their humble origins. The Busker family, migrants like the rest, were some of the first to lay claim to the scattered mass of the Rocky Cloud. Common miners seeking payload and paradise. But when Horvo and others traipsed in with trussy strut, taking boon and quashing peddlers, that turnt them Buskers anti-corpo real swifty. Soon the family's aims angled from peaceful pillage toward straight rustling. Maybe the first true ones, they was. Made a fortune of it too and two generations past. Old Brinn Busker, granddaughter of the chief, were at the helm when the Freight Wars fizzled up from the moldy gaps and she had a taste for corpo blood and corpo money. Over the seasons, them Buskers got real creamy at floating and shooting in tandem.  Soon everyone was hearing of the Headforgers, brutes of mercs, eager to fight for either side so long as the pay was good and the kips were ripe for plucking. And they did. No ear for preaches, just a hard eye for cash and the Man and Dugall both were chuffing. Nowaways every crippled crew is looking for this snack. The visage got a reputation.

This kit's a goofy in-house deal from Horvo. A mineral company, not an outfitters. It's funny how the clubs that flex the strongest when it come to uniformity tend to breed the most discontent. Horvo quipt all the rock fuckers in their stables with these prongs and not long after they all bum-rushed the foreman's office and took to the stars on company craft. Praps the distinctive shadow of the hat is due credit for it's stature as a symbol of anti-corpo independence among the Free Fringers. Shows up in all the posters. It's not a bad hardshell, but not a particularly good one neither. Flat crystal prone to glasscrack and heavy as bhalushit, but that mushroom cap can take a hit. Heard chant that some clever contingents in the Freights found interesting use for these helmets in head-first EVA maneuvers. Comin straight at you, alls you got for a shot is a ricoshield the size of a dinner plate. Try and hit that.

## Trailmaker

Only bob Grom ever made and it shows. Looks clumsy as a friar-gas fiend staggering down the dust strip with scrap strapped all angles over. And while absent the finesse borne of their longstay in weaponry, the Trailmaker, similarly, is all tool. Got a mean combat lean and high spec for the carver what knows how to use it. Like any good sealed bob, the Trailmaker will serve you well humping low on any high-tox surface or otherwise, but where this kit really shines is among the stars. A compact internal gel kit powers a leading sight that runs tighter than it has any right to, capable of plotting sharp trajectories of any warm-bodied flyer. Veteran float-scrappers know that so long as they keep churning butter, most kips gonna be pelting posterior whiffs. But the Trailmaker solves for that, glugging any old grounder pounder into a space-bound sharpshooter. The purists will scoff, but rest easy old guard. Ain't no fancy bob gonna comp for a strapt mind, honed for space combat. Ain't no targeting reticule gonna pass for the ambidirectional awareness and relativistic instinct that can only come from long logs gunning pirates. But it will make you miss less and shoot truer, veteran and kip alike. To tug against the inexorable pull of innovation is to get cramped by the young and we can't let that happen, can we.
