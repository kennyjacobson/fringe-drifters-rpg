## Isol Marra

Isol Marra is a prospective member of the nascent Fringe chapter of the Archival Society for the Documentation and Preservation of Historical and Cultural Materials of the Occupied Spaces, an NGO colloquially known as the Archives of the Occupied Spaces (or, more simply, the AOS.) For the final stage of her thesis, Marra wrote Frontiers, an informational, panoramic portrait of life in the Fringe before, during, after the Freight Wars presented through abridged, open-ended interviews. Intimate conversations with her grandmother, Quenn Marra, comprise numerous entries in the thesis. The elder Marra, a native to Dobitt's Hem, spent much of her life at the Lapor Pivot, a Dugall-built refueling and logistics station established by Dugall Freight in orbit around Earlie Prime.

## Nelya Gils

Nelya Gils was a loyal mid-level member of the Vay Party. An adolescence spent in the Post-Rosen Age inculcated an unwavering sense of national pride in her generation. As the Party descended into totalitarianism at the hands of Ara Vay during the period that would later be identified as The Inexorable Wilting, a deluge of Party Members and citizens, hoping to avoid their comrades' brutal fates of censorship, imprisonment, and exile, attempted to renounce their citizenship and flee. This brutal era created fecund ground for a variety of nuanced, rich countercultures, including robust art and music scenes, which later found new life in The Fringe. Gils' devotion to the Party, particularly through her passionate defenses of Ara Vay's brutality and propagandistic annals, led her to survive the Expurgations, unlike many of her fellow Party Members.

## Vil Sade

Born into the Rosen Age of Vayon, renowned theorist Vil Sade joined the cadres of the BC elite when a handful of members took note of his discourses on political philosophy and artful translations of texts. Well into his shrewd diplomatic and advisory career, he was approached by Nilas Macon, a young oligarch intent on reviving the legacy of his grandfather, Nilas the Grand, the illustrious military leader at the crux of the Re-Enlightenment. Sade accepted Nilas Macon's offer and provided counsel through a variety of mediums. After several seasons and a number of mediocre business ventures - most of which Sade had warned against - Macon's recalcitrance grew insurmountable to Sade; concurrently, his unethical political tactics had entered the public eye. Realizing the predicament before him, Sade, fearing further tarnishment to his character, publicly and ruthlessly denounced Macon and fled to the Fringe, where he carved a simpler life as a toad farmer.

## Beshtala-Chanko Labor Collective

The Beshtala-Chanko Labor Collective was a short-lived but productive group of drifters who, alongside their trades, devoted themselves to scholarly pursuits. They were motivated by utopian impulses, believing that free and useful information would improve social life in The Fringe and that commercial competition and mechanical progress were functions of free and useful information. The operation folded when an unknown operative bombed their second printing press.

## Tridobal Hippet

Tridobal Hippet was the pseudonym of Fani Piredi, a gastrotech connected variously to many of The Fringe's most successful outfits, including Ruggle and Doruff. Her employment in the gastro industry allowed her to pass between high and low circles, producing travel accounts combining anthropological observation and local history. Most famous is, A Natural and Philosophical History of Heddy's Spit, It's Land, People, and Legends in Three Volumes, Including a Lexicon of Prospecting Terms and Terminology. An abridged version is sold as Heddy's Spit: A Natural History.

## Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

Fowes Trent started his career as an anonymous security contractor, but his audacious and much publicized mutiny of Mad Foreman Jonesy vaulted him to legendary status. Riding the momentum of the coup, Trent donned his self-coined moniker "The Godbird" and formed his infamous crew of mercs - the Cove Stalkers - who rose to become one of the most prestigious mercenary armies operating in The Fringe. Of late, he's settled into his celebrity status with a life of leisure amongst Beshtala-Chanko's elite, occasionally publishing self-aggrandizing tales of his adventures in The Fringe. Excerpts from Armaments of The Fringe: An Anthology of Insights from the Legendary Commander of the Cove Stalkers were used to compile this compendium.

## Pettrik Dilkie

Primarily known for his Book of Mouth Machines, Pettrik Dilkie worked as a low-level engineer in Dorty & Dorty's manufacturing enterprises. The Book of Mouth Machines is peppered with real insights and technical detail, but its credibility is marred by Dilkie's compulsive apologetics for Dorty Dorty and her questionable commercial practices and labor standards. Read it to learn something about mouth machines, not for its revisionist historical accounts.

## Fancy Karl

Fancy Karl is a decorated Freight Wars veteran and long-standing bounty hunter on the payroll of Round Power. Known for his frank manner, Fancy Karl was hired by Man Earlie and became a close confidant. He's continued to serve the Round Power regime under Man Earlie's daughter Klem and presently his grandson Frederick. While idling on Earlie Prime in the relative lull following the Freight Wars, Fancy Karl got roped into writing a gear review column for The Hazy Star, Earlie Prime's weekly newspaper. However, more compelling than the reviews themselves are the insights contained within. An intimate peek into Fringeling life from one of it's most weathered Drifters.

## Perse, the Conservator

The majority of objects and specimens in the Museum of Experience were collected by Perse, the Conservator, who spent decades engaged in anthropological research throughout The Fringe. Perse's other lifelong task was the production of Field Notes: A Polemic. Available in fourteen volumes, the Field Notes reveal Perse's observations, musings, and deep connection to a figure known as "Padulweis" - sometimes "Paddulwheeze" or "Padulweiss" or "PaDULwise" - the addressee of the journals. Extant manifests and records have not independently corroborated the existence of any Padulweis.

## Dugall Freight

After the Free Squares Treaty ended the Freight Wars, Dugall Freight opened the floodgates, hoping to recruit all manner of migrants to test their fortunes in The Fringe. In an effort to promote Fringeling life to prospective Drifters, they published a series of informational books including The Entrepreneur's Guide to Expeditioncraft in The Fringe, which we have sampled for this collection.

## Bak Tremons

Little is know of Bak Tremmons other than that he was one of the first independent trappers to practice in The Fringe. Earlie Prime served as his base of operations for his many expeditions and became his permanent home in retirement, where he was briefly recruited by The Hazy Star, Earlie Prime's weekly newspaper, to contribute to their regular gear review column, in which he offered his insights on items related to the procurement of Fringeling flora and fauna.

## Rav Corver

Rav Corver was a lifelong Stag of the Rahv Chanko Barracks. The RCB is the Chanko Regime's most prestigious class of state soldier, with a heritage extending back to the reign of Queen Chanko herself. His career took him all over the Occupied Spaces with campaigns across both Besthala Chanko and The Fringe. When The Maven, Beshtala-Chanko's premier aristocratic newspaper, published a series on the history of the Chanko Regime's military accoutrement, profiling relevant manufacturers, Corver was commissioned to contribute.
