**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Mark Stay was a legendary artist. His sculptural and architectural work in Beshtala Chanko was highly regarded, but the fame drove him to seek hermitage out in The Fringe well before Man Earlie or any other established industrial presence had staked their claims. Many consider him to be the first ever Drifter and that his masterpiece - a grand utopian settlement design - exists, waiting to be discovered, somewhere out in The Fringe. Bearing his signature mark out of reverence to his legend has become fashionable among drifters.

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Conceived during The Freight Wars, the Cross were Man Earlie's highest-ranking mercenary knights. Many led their own campaigns, commanding battalions of bandits and rustlers across the many diverse venues of the conflict. The Cross lives on today under Man Earlie's grandson Frederick, though they do not enjoy the same reputation they once had. Frederick Earlie is notoriously loose with his allotment of new memberships and anyone who can tickle his macabre humors with stories of their own exploits makes themselves a prime candidate.

**Element Code:** HOME

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

Unlike the Orbital Miners Guild, the Subsurface Miners Guild holds a much tighter grip on their constituency, aided by the fact that large planetary mining operations remain monopolized by corporate endeavors.

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Helmets & Masks

The Engineers Guild represents engineers across all sectors, though the majority of their membership is comprised of freight specialists. Much to the ire of Man Earlie, the Guild was unofficially a major asset to Dugall Freight's efforts during the Freight Wars, pulling a large section of Round Power's engineer staff and bringing their powerball mining operations to a halt for a short time. Scholars contend the Guild's abandoment of Round Power led to the subsequent proliferation and weaponization of many bands of pirates and raiders across the Fringe as Man Earlie scrambled to rebuild his army.

The SlashPatchers are a small but extremely potent band of pirates. Their name comes from their deranged hull-breaching technique: riding a manned rocket straight into the hull of their targets.

If you ever encounter a SlashPatcher, tread softly.
