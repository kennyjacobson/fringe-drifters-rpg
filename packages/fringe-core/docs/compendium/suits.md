# Suits

## Gutter Shirt

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

Cheap and plentiful ain't a bad thing. Drapes is rough, but drapes is hardy and what good is a soft touch if it can't take some tumble? Bakka Filk, known for their penchant to push the limits of what can and should be turnt from whole cloth (yes, even bobs), gets some low chant for their quality. Are they the clothier of choice for miscreants and gutter punks? No doubt. They use cheap fabrics and keep their prices drummy. But disposability can be an asset when comes to the dirty grind of Fringeling work and call me a trussie if I'm ever caught snubbing nose at pure utility. Grow up, kips.

## Smocker

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Isol Marra

...real dusty in the Sayer Belt, especially that deep...was a dirty vein of argemite, anyway...it compromised easy and kicked up warm rubble...Standow-Macon had no qualms about forsaking its men when things severely shat the bed...When rockspray pelted the transport beyond repair, well, they just presumed the crew would die afore they could demand their tale. Sketchy enough to navigate the Belt and a paunched transport could never make it out intact...but most of that crew was decked in smockersuits...Channelcraft suits have always been high quality...among the best you can get in the Fringe at that price point, really...Such a caliber of insulation protects men from the elements, and, for these men, let them get real deep and clatty into the bowels of their ships. Managed to rig some of their skiffs to withstand a long haul...they still had all the Standow-Macon creds so they headed for the nearest operation...They cramped the SM reps and recruited the rest...pos wasn't all that hard neither. Nilas Macon had long since fallen out of favor...Vil Sade's public rebuke had irreparably crippled any rep that he had clung to...and contract miners, by nature, have scant fealty to their employers...The Melchor Brood took form from the survivors and their mutinous recruits and they menaced pockets of the Fringe for some time...shacked up with Man Earlie pretty quick. A real boon. Formidable in the Freight Wars...

## Kreegal Cloak

![Kreegal Cloak](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r307.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Isol Marra

...that redge period not long after the Freight Wars...kipper crews of paunchy researchers and the like...mostly flats who got gloveslapped by the true nature of Fringeling life. [Like who?] Like the Chrova Hush. What did they expect?...trussed-up cads with Rosek complexes...bound for the dustiest tracts of the Fringe...lux touring to shoot tranqed bush bears from showy rides...the Rovers were right to gank 'em. But the Kreegal Outfit on Terrask...they should've been more frosty, but they couldn't have known. [A long pause. She sighs.] Freer sponsored a lot of those early Grovebound expeditions. For good reason, too. Their cloaks were in fine fettle. Humid seasons in the Grove are brutal...fickle weather...all that rain and pollen...shedders landing on your shoulders...but a Freer calle fares well all through the Fringe. Real craftsmanship there...Back then, not much was known 'bout Terrask beyond its lush tangles. Abundant wildlife, too. So Kreegal posted up. Immersed in rich biota, all those hunters and gastrotechs had full plates...rip techs went bogging and found Terrask leaf. Tried it, of course. They didn't know nobody should consume the leaf direct and raw...let alone experience all that allecaine refracted in a mouth machine. Mire Leaf was safe with Dorty & Dorty mandibles...but those early-gen Nevil mouth machines...shoddy construction. Shit filters...even when the techs put known edibles thought the mandibles, every use of that contaminated data gelatin only wore those men closer and closer to the bone. With all that unfiltered allecaine amplified and coursing the chefs, it didn't take long for the rest of the crew to be affected, as well. They tried to keep notes, good scientists that they were, and document the havoc wrought on their minds and bodies, but any journals and diaries were illegible within decacycles. By the time anyone else noticed the silence, all were dead or missing...ranting wild among the bogs. Fucking shame.

## Grounder Pounder

![Grounder Pounder](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r308.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

Close-quarter fluid snaps - or C-KAFS - are a nasty reality of warfare in the frontier or otherwise. Seasoned vets are all too familiar with the deceivingly benign hiss and snap that signals one thing: get out and get low. C-KAFS were improvised from mining equipment during the Freight Wars. They're extremely dangerous to fabricate, but all the materials are readily available at any subsurface mining operation. Set on a timer, detonated remotely, or slung from afar, when C-KAFS snap off, they first inundate the area with a thick vapor (the hiss) that acts as a substrate for a deadly seismic wave (the snap) to pulse through. Any enclosed membrane (eye balls, organs, arteries) within the vapor cloud are at risk of rupture. The introduction of Tovoka Rainment's TR506P Impact Sheath greatly reduced the lethality of the C-KAFS that plagued those frontier hot spots. The flexible sheath tiles absorb and neutralize the bulk of the seismic blast, allowing the wearer to focus on the objective at hand. The only downside? The weight. Mercs groan when contracts take them into C-KAFS territory, but you'll never find a combat vet without the Grounder Pounder on hand, not a live one anyways.

## Vayon Worksuit

![Vayon Worksuit](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r303.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Nelya Gils

Inspired by the uniforms worn by Party members on Vayon itself, the Troik Regal Teorac Temper was built to withstand mitinal particles of all temperatures emitted by edical plants while maintaining the spirit and likeness of Vayon's BC metropolitan. These suits were worn by all resident workers of Fringebound Vay Party members, differing only in minute iterations of color in the name of the intrinsic classless spirit. In recent seasons, rogue Fringeling textile wrights have appropriated the patented design, producing cheap counterfiets that lack the authentic teorac fibers, bodily protection, and classless Vay spirit imparted by genuine Teorac Tempers. Take heed, nowaways, the sight of a Vayon Worksuit no longer dependably represent members of the Vay. Splintered expeditionary Vay groups continue to produce the bastardized design, but despite these groups' claims of secession and new codes laden with reactionary ideology, the Vay Party maintains legislative and executive authority over its chapters in the Fringe. Much of the secessionist ideology is predicated on unfounded rumors that the early-generation edical plants were created to serve as naught but penal colonies. This is entirely untrue. Such a lack of civility runs entirely counter to the principles of the Vay Party (see legal code, sections 2.62.004 through 2.67.033; 8.11.215).

## Deverin Jacket

![Deverin Jacket](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r305.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Nelya Gils

This versatile suit, one of several commissioned through the Halsson Raiment Corporation for the Deverin Minor rig workers, boasts a lightweight, insulating FabraTek constitution, providing ease of movement and comfortable temperature regulation. With ample space for rank pins and Reflector Patches, the Arvis-Halsson Suit has become a common sight on countless corporate enterprises. Such pervasiveness is for good reason: unlike other envirosuits, the distinctly versatile Arvis-Halsson suit can be worn comfortably both outdoors (in temperate conditions) and in enclosed environments. Arvis Industrial's recent acquisition of the Halsson Raiment Corporation brought forth a new wave of popularity for numerous Halsson suits. Arvis Industrial made a number of changes to the Halssons, including flostic enhancement of teorac fibers, which now repel airborne particulates up to Level 3. The Deverin Minor rig workers had remained unchafed by the stitive clouds created by the rig drills, but now, any drifter with a new Arvis-Halsson need not worry about seepage during anthetical seasons, on quaggy moons, or ennamic puffs released by mesting marrow pods. This suit was built to maintain and preserve its wearer for seasons on end. They're Halssons at their core, they're nice.

## Pitchfork Prongshell

![Pitchfork Prongshell](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r311.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

They don't make em like this anymore. Used to see these everywheres. Standard issue for brigaders on all sides back during The Pitchforking, those amorphous agricultural land spats that piped up for seemingly no reason at all across the whole Soil Band. Light and dextrous padded armor. Easy to bear and decent impact grading. Quick pop on the shoulders of any old farmer. But far as I know, Glennery clamped their whole line of combat wares to try to pivot into milkwater fashion faffery. And look how that's gone for them. Shoulda stuck with the right and rigid. But if you're lucky enough to snag a specimen, hold fast because supply is limited.

## Prongshell

![Prongshell](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r306.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Vil Sade

I understand that, in the wake of my warning against partnering with Standow Mining, you wish to pursue jelly-mining on Gallus in the Sayer Belt. I must warn you - though you know this from my past guidance - that jelly caves are recurrently freezing and entirely aphotic. Devoid of sunlight, hyperspec vision and precise temperature control is mandatory. Of course, I acknowledge that numerous organizations have led successful jelly-harvesting ventures in environs whose conditions which are indeed quite comparable to those on Gallus. However, despite later success, Deaconcore's initial expeditions to the Jocum Haze Caves were disastrous and quite lethal. Well established research indicates that direct contact with many of the common variants of jelly does much discreet harm to the mind and body. Of course, I grant that Jocum variant is not so harmful via dermal contact, but members of those early Deaconcore outfits - those which were decked in early-generation Starsight - curdled like morons. I warn against use of this outfitter. I understand the appeal of the promised abilities and price, but such a compromise - especially one so bound to sanity and the fate of your ventures - is hardly necessary for a man of your means. Many alternate outfitters provide miner helmets with adequate visibility in puredark environs and suits with full protection from Level 7 particulates. You have expressed interest in a specifically invernal expedition to Gallus. Indeed, the orbital position results in lower fuel costs and freezing temperatures do yield easier techniques for the harvesting of microbial mats, but again, I warn you, such an approach is deceptively challenging. The axial tilt of Gallus yields unforgiving winters upon already-tundrid landscapes. Despite the typical classifications of Gallusian mag, temp, and pressure, in winter, the subterranean caves meet the conditions of Class 7 Tempzones. Far superior insulation is required for even the frailest promise of a successful venture. I advise against trimming fat, as that is entirely unnecessary for someone as well-endwoed as yourself. Brigund Beeter suits have found popularity throughout the Fringe and in the extremes of the BC, as their superior constitution can insulate a cove in EVA for cycles on end. They provide the best raiment for traversing the casts of moons in the depths of the Sayer Belt.

## Duggie

![Duggie](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r301.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

Dugall's iconic diagonal sash goes back metaseasons into the corpo-state days of the BC annals and - true to their penchant for interplanetary dominance - were some of the first "uniforms" to plant boots in The Fringe. A signifier of origin and gainful employment to some, the degradation of self to the old oppressive old money machine. Of course, when the Freight Wars kicked off, it became a banner of allegiance to the BC establishment at large. Don't mean much of anything anymore though. Dugall pumped so many human resources into The Fringe to fuel the conflict that the second-hand flightsuits of fallen kips flooded the market like bingebats in heat. Nowaways a Dugall flightsuit is near standard issue for first-gen drifters, badges tastefully removed of course. It's BC-made so it hangs service good as. Just be wary where you flaunt it's heritage. Could still get you shivved if you stumble into a holdout colony.

## Platemail

![Platemail](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r403.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

"Beware the figgy man's clack" as the saying goes. The telltale light 'clack' (though most say it's more of a chime) of hullscrap platemail announces the wearer well before they've arrived. Large merc groups that draw conscripts from the loweries of BC are issued the minimally protective plate mail so that they can move fast during raids.  The mercs deploy conscripts during large actions that require extra gyre and are utilized as expendable battle assets. Being fully aware of this fact, they fight like they have nothing to lose, often carrying out their attacks with suicidal vigor, the prelude being the signature clacking' of the hullscrap platemail.

## Fursuit

![Fursuit](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r312.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

If you ever have the rare fortune of smashing mugs with a Hesh, it's an experience you'll take to your grave. They're true animals in both the field and the pub. Take my chant as you will, but I once clipped an invite to the Capitol Party in the walled city itself. Someone in the Chanko Circle caught wind of my Rocky Cloud exploits, exaggerated down the chain, no doubt. And of course, there were Hesh in company. You couldn't miss them, laden in furs, matted with grease and grit. How those grizzlies endeared themselves so wholly with the topsoil, I'll never understand. But they sure party hard. Twas at this romp I seen a BC baron try to swap a full purse for a Hesh fursuit. Man ended up with drink on his dome and was laughing for it. Such is the strange charismatic power of the Hesh. The suits themselves are a sight to behold, a specimen of rarified craftsmanship from a whole nother order. If The Fringe were to garnish it's own aristocracy, I'd put the brutish Hesh at the top of the triad. But rest assured, you ain't never gonna feel the heavy drape of this sort of craftsmanship on your own shoulders lest you cramp a Hesh, and I don't reckon that'll ever be in your stars.

## Satchel

![Satchel](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r318.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Rav Corver

Tovoka is the first choice clothier for combat-forward garb and the Satchel is their base-layer, hard-working, go-anywhere specimen. Light, breathable, yet rugged. Packed with storage for quick access to munitions, navtoolery, or otherwise. It's my personal choice for versatile canvas and plucks to most any gig or scrape. Clipped my first edition as a fresh recruit to the Rahv Chanko Barracks and if it's good enough for Stags, it's good enough just about any use-case. Never looked back.
