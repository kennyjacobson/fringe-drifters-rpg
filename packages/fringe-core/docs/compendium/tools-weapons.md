This is an unwieldy best, but alarmingly effective if you can wrangle it's heft. Used surface or float, nothing stands in the way of Chanko's Power Hammer. It's apt nickname comes from it's headline feature: a grip-activated chem-powered thruster at the hammer's head, lending the user supernatural smashing power. Tread with caution, though. While the power it bestows is undeniably appealing to anyone looking to breach hard, if you lack the personal mass the control its trajectory, violent side-effects can ensue. Shattered legs, ricochet backlash, and uncontrolled flying spirals are not uncommon among denizens of the Thruster.

Durable, portable, and cheap, Magkery's Basic Core Sampler allows even the least-dextrous of prospectors to rapidly survey soil at depths of up to two rods. These core samplers were mass-produced during a period of metabolic crisis, when shipments of agricultural fertilizer shuddered to a halt during the Freight Wars. Discovery of FN-87 ("spunk") in shallow soil fractured the Earlie Blockade from within, enriching prospectors (who could identify the signature blue-green deposits without need for chemical analysis), smugglers (who lumbered bricks of FN-87 and profiteered in the way they always do), and Magkery himself. The coring implements were sold at a loss to drifters, who would locate concentrations of spunk that Magkery could then seize and monopolize. A paper presented at a meeting of the Beshtala-Chanko Society of Agronomists estimates that 74-77% of all FN-87 sold during the Blockade passed through Magkery hands.

## The Shriek

Yes, field antennae increase the range in which a signal can be broadcast. You've been injured and need surgical attention or herbal remedy. The other half of your mercantile venture walks off one day into the vastness of the Fringe and you want to tell them that all is forgiven if they can unball themselves from whatever hole they crawled into, slink back to camp, and pick up a hammer. Bounty hunters are tightening the net on a contact that - nefarious as she is - for your own best interests, you would rather not see netted. Whatever. Amplify your signal all you want. Say what you're thinking. They can't stop you. Consider, for instance, that the Shriek received its moniker from a lone drifter who, from somewhere in the vast jungle of Heddy's Spit, used his antenna to inflict psychic terror on whoever he could find on the open channels. For months, Granz the Shriek was on, it seemed, every channel. "Good day, mine sonorous syphillated sirens", he would say. "What songs sing thee to my sweet sound-boxes this swelterine season?" Find a lower, unused channel. Whisper as quietly as possible about wind interfering with the day's excavation and there would be Granz reciting entry after entry from his "Journal of Flatulence." Bawdy meteorology detailing the day's wind and hail. Denizens of the Spit chalked his gibberish up to madness. Fringe fever. Parasitic infection. The ethereal fingers of cosmic dread playing with the coils of his brain. The real story was more prosaic. Granz had inadvertently discovered and consequently subsisted off glow mash - a mild stimulant in low doses and, in large doses, a powerful hallucinogen. The Shriek gave voice to the Shriek. But the true power of the Shriek isn't screaming at all but, instead, is telepathic. Let someone else find that aquifer, that vein of ore, that overgrowth of spores beneath the weeping bloom of some blighted shrub. Let them say what they're thinking and there you are listening, already inside of their minds, the bulbous arachnid at the center of the web ready to take and monger what they have carefully gathered.

## Round Foot

**Author:** Tridobal Hippet

There are no flat planets but everywhere it spreads, the human virus seeks to flatten each planet it encounters. Wherever there is a mountain, grind it down into its mineral parts. Wherever there are holes and fissures, fill them in. Wherever there are swamps, drain them and plant the old crops planted everywhere else. However innocent the soil tamper appears, it is the totality of human fantasy made manifest in a simple tool. Soil tampers entered the fringe for construction projects, for flattening long-term shelters and preparing field-stations for stable experiments. But miners and prospectors grokked a new use for the Round Foot, which became useful for packing barrels of spunk (FN-87). The substance, both chunky and globulent, requires painstaking pummeling for proper packing - eased by the mechanical force and chemical charge of the tamper. The Round Foot also let drifters minimize contact with the fertilizer which, with enough exposure, could corrode fabrics and, worse, lead to wasting sicknesses and mysterious maladies. The most common symptoms reported are spunk finger and spunk noz - but no reports come from the dead, unless the mediums in the bowels and warrens of the Lighthouse District are to be countenanced. The tamper also became briefly-famous in internecine conflict when a sept of spunk prospectors turned the instrument towards a foreman who had gambled away two months of work. The Round Foot could crush rock - or every bone in a hand all at once.

## Hull Breacher

![Hull Breacher](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r511.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

Seems the Fringeling ilk possess a pervasive climmer to ensure that anything that can be a weapon will be used as such. Tis a humble surveyor's pick, intended elucidate spackle and veins by splitting rock of all kinds, though most oft in the roid fields. Just one look at the jagged edges, apex hammer, terminal spike, and it's not difficult to conjure images of rustler spats gone wrong. A quick thrust and steel slides through ankle bone. A frictionless sweep to a shattered visor. Even in the realms outside close combat, I've known these fine-edged hooks to find employ in the kit of big game trappers, capable of gutting bhalu and creeper alike. But it's the high-tension clamping feature that propagated it's namesake use-case. The Hull Breacher. While the evolutionary path of miner to rustler to pirate is well trod, reaching back to the days when Queen Chanko reigned, Man Earlie's little war did much to expedite the process. And when you apply pressure to the throttle of natural evolution, things are bound to get crunchy. While I hold little in the way of respect for those who elect the pirate class, those Rovers - borne of Freight Wars fallout - sure knew how to float. Their tactical blend of agile skiffs, thruster bikes, and rustling-nurtured EVA prowess reached levels unparalleled in my line of sight. And if there's one discipline they mastered - nay, pioneered - it's planting a hook in a hull. Clamped like leeches. Sliced like paper. Spilling contents, be they wares, ores, or in the tragic case of Feigngull...passengers.

## Chainflicker

![Chainflicker](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r502.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Tridobal Hippet

There was a rush on broemite after Ruggle stumbled across a seam in the hills above Heddy's Spit. In the first few years the rush was viscous, hampered by a dearth of tools, infrastructure, and the timber necessary to prevent the tunnels and shafts of the broemite mines from caving. Trees were everywhere - soft lungfruit trees, inadequate for bearing weight, and traafir trees. The traafir wood is suitable for the mines - long-grained, elastic, durable - but the dense bark hampered early efforts to clearcut by hand. Imagine yourself up in the hills, ankle-deep in mud, unable to scratch itch on your own nose behind your crystal, sharpening the dull hatchet that you sharpened only an hour ago while you were hacking at the very same tree that you still need to hack for hours more. Then you hear the rumbling belch of a freighter. You and the other prospectors in the surrounding hills spontaneously cheer, because you already know what the shipment contains: a thousand gleaming cases of Pip's Smooth-Cut Chainflickers that will liberate the industry and commerce of an entire planet. You yourself, in your rush down the hill, already feeling the ergonomic rubber grip of the flicker in your hand, might stumble down a slope, crack your head against the very trees you wanted to crack, and perish in a gush of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Dying, your hands might even twitch a phantom saw through phantom tree trunks. You did it, and you didn't. But you are, in the end, irrelevant to the progress of the galaxy. There are hundreds of others who will carry on your work - and hundreds did, clearcutting the hills like so many human termites. Timber propped up the mines, spanned bridges across the valleys, streams, and crevices in the hills, and advanced the built environment of the Spit beyond the ramshackle tents and hovels of the first wave of drifters. Two-story buildings - a colossal victory over gravity. What's a mudslide compared to that?

## Wedge

**Author:** Dugall Freight

It's a shovel. It features an adjustable handle length, collapsing short for tunnel digs and storage. There's a pop-out footplate for extra thrust into the soil. There's not much more to say. It's a shovel. Standard issue for many a Fringeling prospector looking to carve their fortune from beneath the surface of the wilderness abroad. It's hard work, rough work, and no tool makes the relentless grind any easier, but this digger will serve that goal as well as any. It's a shovel. Aside from the occasional handle jam, these tools work well. Magkery isn't exactly heralded for workmanship, but you don't always need the cream. It's a shovel.

## Death Beam

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

Pure energy, dilated to a needle blade. Tis a scary thing. Scarier still when you realize it's a ghost, invisible to the eye. The power drain to run this sort of kit is hefty. It's a cumbersome craft, mandating vat batteries, generators, or a direct tap into a starcraft engine to find it's fury. But that, in my view, is a reassuring tradeoff for the sheer destructive force the Death Beamer spews from it's massive prick. If any cove could waltz with a sabre of this magnitude, the world would be a different place. But no man, save a mech, could wield this beast on the surface. A natural governor for a terrifyingly potent chaotic energy. Course, float is a different arena. A silent slice splits a hull, and spills all innards into the void - be they treasure or soft-tissue. But another fortunate governor is price. These things cost no trivial pile of coin to both acquire and maintain so they tend to run in only the shiniest of mining crews. Once got called into a corporate roid dig that got rolled by pirates. Had just one of these Beamers on roster, but soon as that bit of intel came down the wire, we spun our ships round. Ain't no way seige skiffs should be anywheres near a Death Beamer in the hands of a pirate. Had to call in the big lobbers on that one and I admit I breathed a mite easier knowing one more of these beasts had been evaporated from the dark marketplace.

## Reef Sweeper

![Reef Sweeper](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r515.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

The reef-sweeper is a quality, all-purpose, one-piece choke blade. A bandy cohort of my own Stalkers are quipt with Rowell metal for this reason. Godbird approved, signed and sealed. Keeps an edge like no other, ready for all manner of grass, vine, or pry-job. But it's the weight (or lack thereof) and immaculate balance that tips this piece over the edge. Hard working utility, but combat-ready. A flick of the wrist and you can bleed a cove dry. Mastering the blade is it's own discreet art and the ease of the cut makes this a sharp danger to those who've yet to grow the limb. So if you intend to fight, be sure you're quipt in mind before you're quipt in metal.

## Seam Ripper

![Seam Ripper](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r505.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Beshtala-Chanko Labor Collective

Until the development of CGC batteries, petrospectors depended on crank-operated drills, bulky pneumatic canisters and compressors, and the power of their own arms to rock-break with hammers and picks. CGC batteries, re-charged autonomously by the drill's own operations, liberated small-knot prospectors to venture further afield. Without the Ripper, it is unlikely that Ruggle's discovery of broenite seams would have fomented any sort of rush, let alone a flood. Lapidary drill bits allow the Ripper to core rock faces (hollow heads) or simply bore (rotary heads.) The portability of the Seam Ripper also appeals to rustlers, although atmosphere-stable lubricants must be meticulously replaced with dry film lubrication for the drills to be used on the volatile surface of an asteroid. The mural originally advertising the Ripper depicted a prospector on some steep scree, drill over one shoulder, ambiguous lump of ore raised victoriously over her head. The mural has since faded, but the text at the top is still legible: Get Quipt, Get Pip's.

## The (Fat) Koltso

![The (Fat) Koltso](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r517.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Beshtala-Chanko Labor Collective

The Koltso Dredulite Railgun operates by projecting metallic munitions through two parallel rails by electromagnetic rather than chemical force. The conductive capacities of dredulite provide an efficient metal for the electromagnetic circuit of the Koltso, but it remains a heavy weapon preferred by mercenaries rather than a casual defensive tool for drifters engaged in commercial pursuits. While munitions are light and easy to manufacture, the core of the Koltso is the heavy Shavirham battery that ignites the electromagnetic process and can generate up to one hundred and seventeen rounds before it must be exchanged with a new cartridge. Calibrated for the maximum number of charges, the electromagnetic force is strong enough to pierce most suits or even compromise the hulls of light craft from close range. Calibrated for maximum penetration, the charge is strong enough to puncture steel plating from a range of quarter square. This model includes a bulkier barrel modified to allow for increased range over the standard Koltso. Accounts from survivors at the Hotel Gullard massacre agree that the assailants carried Fat Koltsos painted black. This detail - understandably overlooked in most historical records because of the aftermath of the massacre - has lingered in the whispered legends of drifters and led many a bitter strongarm to paint their own Koltso black in solidarity.

## Everdull Snippies

**Author:** Tridobal Hippet

When the Beacon Slope Landslide buried the northern districts of Heddy's Spit in mud and water and broemite tailings, Ruggle was in the hills inspecting his mines. There had been certain rumors. Prospectors setting down their tools and disappearing into long-abandoned branches. Strange echoing whispers channeled through the earth by metallic veins. Purple vapors on the edge of vision. These rumors came amidst other problems in Ruggle's refineries and foundries. For years, the mid-day meal for the foundry workers was prepared by gastrotech Fani Piredi who, through her spagyrical culinary practice, could transform alien roots, tubers, and lichen into edible cuisine for the masses. This was a happy arrangement until Ruggle refused to supply salt - an expensive import - for the company kitchen and Piredi resigned in disgust. Hungry workers are unhappy workers. Ruggle knew all of this and yet, when he boarded the gondola to descend back to the city, little thought of what dreams of violence an unhappy worker might dream. In the chaos of the monsoon and mudslide, no one noticed the Hinh sisters clamber on to the lower gondola platform with their powersnips. These clippers were foundry tools, used to shear and trim broemite rods in the absence of large-scale machinery on the planet. Powered by ESE cartridges, the snips employed explosive force and - however they were advertised - required sharpening long before they required new sources of power. So, when the Hinh sisters brought their powersnips to the gondola platform, it was but the work of a moment to sever the two cables bearing Ruggle's cabin and plunge him into the curdled earthen maelstrom below. There, the story goes, he found what he was looking for in his mines.

## Ball Claw

**Author:** Dugall Freight

The Ball Claw is something of an icon in The Fringe, commissioned by the Man Earlie Expeditionary Society after the discovery of the powerball swamps on Earlie Prime. Nowaways, Round Power's skiff-based harvesting operations are much more sophisticated, but this power grappler is what started it all, knee-deep in muck, wresting powerballs by hand. Earlie's commission vaulted Fringe-native outfitters, Magkery, to the status they enjoy today and their flagship grappler still hasn't lost relevance. Though made quickly obsolete in the Round Power-dominated powerball industry, the grappler has found new life across a variety of other industries - from chip-mining asteroids to plucking all sorts of bounty from the Fringe's many muck-based environs.

## The Slipper

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

Never been one to fetishize sword fighting, an obsolete art by my reckoning when every fresh kip is packing some kinda thrower. But I know the craft's acolytes would have me skinned for such sacrilege and I cast no shadow of disrespect on the sophistication of the discipline. Many a time, I pledged my own life debt to a fortuitous blade in the hand. That just not to say I wouldn'tve rather clasped a set o rails. There's no reckoning a blade can be a proficient dealer of death, but I keep mine for utility first. However, those who have been innoculated by the dark arts of bladecraft, Rowell's Slipper is a creamy proposition. Hard cutting for path slashing and a dollop of serration make it a capable tool. But it's perfect balance sets it spinning round the wrist with ease, opening the skill ceiling to the master swordsman and doling lopped flesh to the foolish amateur.

## The Koltso

![The Koltso](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r518.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Beshtala-Chanko Labor Collective

Prior to the invention of the Koltso, railguns in the Fringe were tools used to drive metal bolts into rock. These early tools, like the weapons that followed, project munitions through the use of electromagnets in the barrel rather than through chemical (or alchemical) force. They were of particular use in the narrow shafts of dredulite mines, where explosive charges risked igniting known and unknown subterranean gases and transforming sites of industry and commerce into haunted infernos. Like many stories of invention, the birth of the Koltso is an unhappy tale of betrayal. Llars Blim, a dredulite pitman, was made captive in his own mind by his two partners, who wanted to split the lode in half instead of thirds. "Miserable cravens!" he wrote years later. "They would not even annihilate me themselves but left me to suffocate slowly in the nether world. Little did they think that I - careful as always, cautious as always, cunning as always - had cached a second breathing tank in the crannies of an abandoned seam. After two days they opened the mine, thinking to find my corpse. What they found instead was their own DOOM - writ by the barrel of my railgun - and their own tomb!!" Recognizing the martial possibilities for the tool, Llars developed the Koltso as a weapon in itself. The conductive capacities of dredulite provided an efficent metal for the electromagnetic circuit of the Koltso, but it never became a light weapon. The weight of the Koltso, and of the heavy charges necessary for powering the circuit, make it suitable only for mercenaries and other drifters dedicated to securing assets.

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

A bit too heavy for Cove Stalker kit, but this cutter is a beast in the bush. No flash, pure heft. Rowell forges them true and despite my professed love for his Reef Sweeper, the Trunker I'd reckon is his masterpiece. A true Fringeling blade, made to slash through the rigors of this vast, multiduous wilderness. When the stars flare and all of us are reduced to floating dust, the Trunker will live on, offering primitive utility to the space's next intelligent settlers.

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

Seems The Fringe has a way of fixing everything into a weapon, doesn't it? Such was the journey of Solid Metal Harvesting, a humble but quality manufacturer spect in subsurface mining tools. And the introduction of the Compact Koltso seemed to seal their fate in that regard. They're effectively a weapons manufacturer nowaways. I mean, throw your eyes on this thing. It's supposed to be a chiseler, that is, a small mining railgun for precision vein-chasing deep in the tendrils of a reticulum dig. But if to cramp is your wont or your mandate, it's an easy slip to turn these rails to chest or temple. The hole-puncher, ha! Apt. All fairly, a piece like this'll never sling the range of a model made for combat, but punch a hole it will and with an overabundance of confidence for any matter the human form has to offer. Tis a chiseler after all. And while the larger spears govern themselves to a certain extend due to their unwieldiness and niching, a chiseler is just a trigger pull you can hide in your pants. Gotta keep my bonebox locked on specifics per contractual obligations, but not gonna say my Stalkers didn't have to purge a shake of workers' coups thanks to the ill-advised quipping of Hole Punchers to whole contingents of rock humpers.

## The Nozzle

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

Yet another in the long list of meant-for-this, used-for-that. And since it's in this book, reckon you know for what. It's a nozzle, capable of streaming whatever pressurized solution or foam the user requires. There's not much more to say. Twas designed for medical and chemical craft. The application of adhesives and solvents. Anesthetics and liquid bandages. But, of course, it wouldn't challenge even the most unimaginative to reckon how this might be turnt toward lethal ends. Caustics, combustives, even boomerfoam injections. Rapid expansion can be a deadly force and I seen the aftermath of many applications...be it inside the engine bay of a transport or a man's nostrils. Just a flick of the shiv in the Nozzle's governer and you got a sure stream arcing twenty lines forth. The Stalkers were once commissioned to seize a rogue furgame processing facility. Trappers use these nozzles for rapid embalming and logistical taxidermy and this op was kitted to the roof. Once they smelt us coming, all those nozzles were hooked to septics. You'd be surprised how impactful a stench can play on the battlefield. Industrious little fuckers. Human excrement woulda packt enough puke to play nicely, but the thing about trapper septics is they're also rife with animal organs. After the first breach, my boys came back so ripe, none of us was gonna touch a rush. No questions there. Little shits turned a quick cycle job into a season-long waiting game, picking stragglers once their supply spent and they hadta gather fodder. Stankest mid-season of my life.

## Steady Hammer

![Steady Hammer](https://compendium.fringedrifters.com/storage/r508.png)

**Element Code:** HOME
**Author:** Tridobal Hippet

A lighthouse on the coast, but without a single ship, raft, or dinghy on the dismal seas. The structure was made, instead, to mark the steep incline of the coastal hills and prevent incoming pods and landcraft from crashing in the frequent and heavy fogbanks that afflicted Heddy's Spit. The lighthouse itself was unhurt in the Beacon Slope Landslide, but the ground beside it opened up anyway: a maw in the earth that delved deep, deep into the bedrock. A prospector with some amateur and dilettantish studies in rocks and soil declared it a geological mystery, saying that granite (it was not granite) should not be collapsing into sinkholes. Peering over the guardrail at the top of the lighthouse, it looked like some giant tunneling machine had pointed towards the core and bored itself into oblivion. The trouble began when the keeper wondered, instead, if some creature, or thing, or devil had burrowed out. Tupper began to preach to anyone who would listen of the horrors that would be visited upon Heddy's Spit - an easy thing to do when half the settlement was already buried in mud and rotting from flood, and when the miners and prospectors were already huddling together for warmth in the dark. Tupper the Younger, as he styled himself, gathered those lost drifters and incited them to take up their hammers - not for profit but to construct a temple to the unknown specter that, he imagined, had slouched out from the caverns below. The hammers were elevated tools, designed with electronic cuffs that negated the painful vibrations which came from slamming heavy bricks of metal into rock. They had dreams of domes and spires and arabesques, a real cathedral in The Fringe. Without a single architect, mason, or legitimate builder, they could not build even an arched doorway for the entrance. The thing was squat, made of crude blocks of stone in a complex that wrapped around the pit - the lighthouse on one side and a nave on the other linked by cloistered walkways. This was the birth of a cult that brought so much tumult to the planet. They called themselves the Lighthouse Sept.

## Cream Steamer

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

I've borne witness to all flavors of atrocity. There's little left within the vile tapestry of human experience capable of rattling my humor, yet I still shudder at the sight of this piece. "Cream Steamer" is a jape of a name, coined no doubt by its savage acolytes. The concept of respect rings as hollow as their skulls amongst the likes that would bear this evil. I've seen it's victims. Were I to conjure a moniker, it would be "War Criminal". But I've long learned the folly of applying any expectation of civility to the animalistic machinations of The Fringe. No upstanding manufacturer dares to hawk the likes of an incendiary chemical scattergun on the legal market. No, this is a junkyard build. Cobbled from scrap and repurposed components, yet the core schematics have spread like the wildfire it creates. Sticky fire, scattered in globules like spittle from the mouth of a child. There is no precision to be had here, only chaos and destruction. Now I'm one to leverage almost any tactic for strategic advantage, but this is crossing a vivid demarcation, a border of the mind that is as rational as it is moral. One must be bereft of all intent save for the consumption of life itself - including one's own - to heft the handle here. The darkest day in Cove Stalker history fell to a swarm of scattergun-toting holdouts. Now I took no side in the Freight Wars, so I hold no allegiance there. But after the Free Squares Treaty, there remained pockets of fanatics and nearly all of them claimed allegiance to Earlie. That man curried all manner of reek as he scrambled to cling to his sway. He extracted venom from the darkest recesses of space that I reckon should have been kept in the glands. Cultists and marauders honor no law, nor should they be approached with any such presumption. I thought I knew this, but I underestimated the depths of their methods. Death by sticky fire is slow and loud. Never again. Savages, all.

According to the prevailing trapchant, the minter of this grotesque design was some anonymous railmeat who fancied a taste of the skinbirds that flocked the decks of an offshore oil rig on Krepper Seaworld. Thanks to them, we now know skinbirds make good, greasy eating. Any good innovation in the weird realm of junkcraft is liable to spread fast and nowaways, these yawping nets are oft seen in varietals across all manner of trapping crews to cull pest critters in an orderly manner. Strap it to rails and you got a contained killer. Or an engine starter for a stunning shock.

Lawson General really pulled the pin when they dropped this piece into the market. While presented as an innocuous flaregun available at any haberdashery, it was only a matter of cycles before the aftermarket was plunging with all manner of lethal munitions compatible with Lawson's stock firing handle. For the cost of a hot meal, any ruffian could dazzle the bandolier with his pick of poison: slugs, scattershot, torches, even sedgas and smoke. While these hack rounds were quickly outlawed in Beshtala-Chanko, enforcement was another matter. Squarepakt in bar crates, a simple watchword was all that was needed to functionally hawk firepower from behind the counter of any corner shop and BC gutters began to flow with spent candles. Out in The Fringe, no such elusoration is necessary. Candlesticks flow free, allowing even the humblest of Drifters to get quipt for half a shortstack. As such, Lawson General's "flaregun" has become a staple piece of kit, be it for precautionary or more insidious ambitions. As such, The Candlestick has become both a menace in the streets and a safety net for those otherwise disinclined to armament. Still, these one-shot poppers are no match for the rapidity of a good set of rails, so it's not been too much of a hamper to true businessmen. But sometimes one shot is all you need. In the wild reaches of The Fringe, I reckon it's best to get quipt lest you get cramped and at the very least, Lawson's got you covered there.

**Author:** Fowes "The Godbird" Trent

The crude dagger of pelfgrubbers and savages. A stickup wand for wegwax fiends. There is no honor nor couth in wielding the Soaker, an abominable device just as likely to cramp the bearer as its target. As the name implies, the Soaker functions by shooting a stream of vile solution from its nozzle. Range is limited and spray is often scattered. This is far from a precision instrument, more of a desperate last stand. The most common ammunition is Vat Battery Acid, siphoned in back alleys by rot-lipped snackers. It's not the most lethal of tactics, but one does not always have to be lethal to be effective and in many cases, greater lethality would be a humane mercy. Boilsome chem burns head-to-toe. Instant blindness to the visorless victim. This is not the swift death of a railbolt, no. This is a writhing knot of pain and screeching. I've also seen incendiary variations, an obvious mod, turning the streamgun into a single-shot handheld flamethrower. Not a sustainable tactic in standup combat, but highly effective in the rip-and-run use case. But the real menace is their ubiquity. Just a handful of common pipes and components is all you need to scrap together this tortuous piece. A scourge, indeed.

## Soapy

I always wanted a trusty Soapy for my holiday kit. It's a lowbrow piece, but I don't know what it is about it. I love this leemgun. For the uninitiated, these guns use leem powder and a squirt of fizz which pressure-packs the chamber via rapidfoam. Leemguns are a favorite among hunters because the sound is so soft. With the feeble cough of a baby stork, the bolt flies forth with lethal speed, leaving a foamy white trail in it's wake, hence the name. Not the brightest choice for a backwoods scrape, but it's stature as a staple of all walks of frontiersman means I've found myself in the odd leemgun fight and let me tell you, it's a veritable delight. We once cornered a bunch of off-brand trappers, trespassing on rightful herdland, all packing leem. The kips didn't stand a chance, but I gotta say, it's a real satisfying sound when you got a bunch of leemguns all popping off at once. A wheezy chorus with a soapy finish, settling on the field like snow. It's a sight to behold and I always savored it.

## Bolt Harp

A good ole bolt harp is a beautiful thing. Cheap ammunition. Powered purely by the tension you bestow with your own muscle-borne torque. No charge needed. And this specimen goes down in a particularly creamy way. With Calson Wight's old-world heritage of premium manufacturing tolerances, grease or no, this harp will work for ages. Six-shot cylinder and lateral crankshaft for a blistering fire rate when it comes to bolt slingers. Crossbows are a hunter's companion, full stop. There's not any harp that'll stand fast against a set o rails. But if a harp is all you got, a harp'll do nicely. Full disclosure, if you've sensed I wax sentimental, twas this very edition that punched me and the boys into Mad Foreman Jonesy's office back in the day. Wary of mutiny, the bosses put a ban on rails, forcing all the miners to heft picks and shovels, which in turn put a vice on morale. If I've learned anything in my Fringeling career, it's that paranoia more oft than not only serves to expedite the feared outcome. And Jonesy's corpo-kips made the mistake of still keeping three Calson Wight Crossbow Revolvers in the gastro-locker. Their mistake. My big break.

## Cove Carver

The good ole Cove Carver, creamiest side-piece there ever was. And I don't say that just because my crew is the colloquial namesake. I made these standard-issue for my beloved Cove Stalkers for a reason and we earned the moniker by virtue of blood and other split fluids. Twas the extended twin rails of the Grom 665 that left ruddy bite marks on the neck of Mad Foreman Jonesy hisself when yours truly dragged him out onto the porch to seal the Bogram Mining Coup. The inciting incident, as it were, as that was the day the Cove Stalkers were birthed into this world and our destiny was set to mete justice and claw some order in this lawless raucoury we call The Fringe. I challenge any naysayer, yellow or otherwise, to look a Stalker in the eye and chatter his bonebox of sponsorship or payouts. Valor is earned, not given, and our accolades are stolid. Full candor, I've been a Grom stalwart my whole career, but if that don't chant to their workmanship, I don't know what does. This tight little set o' rails has solved many a scrape in my day. Been clipped to my hip since well before my Stalker days and it's reassuring heft tugs gently on my belt as I write. Compact, yet sturdy. Extended rails give it a range that, in the right hands, can paint a kip with confidence indistinguishable from that of any stocky. And to pound the rim shut, a couple reverse cranks of the trigger-pull throws a dollop of charge back into your empty cap for a low-power shot in a pinch. Won't hose any brains, but, capless and pinned, I once held off a full skiff crew of Rovers from the confines of a sheet closet using only my trusty 665 and that manual recharger. Barring a melted chamber, the Cove Carver won't flicker resentment at any price or age and I pledge the integrity of the Stalker code to that claim.

## Faulk's Icepick

Shame my Stalkers didn't nab the namesake. We were throwing metal off these rails well before Seb Faulk got it in his loon to bag that abominable ice creeper. I love this piece, but it always comes with the faint stank of petty jealousy. It teeters on the crest of laughable to call it a hunting longrail. I know Grom presents it as such, but anyone with flashmarks on their knuckles will clock regulatory trickery from half a square away. The HR40 is a sniper of the highest order, crafted to exceed the rigors of combat. When I lay eyes on the Icepick, my mind wanders to the Cove Stalkers and the immaculate crescent we clamped on Boscoe Rim. Five longrails was all it took, painting two bands worth of Redtops full-cycle til the very last of those dumb-faced raiders smacked the bog without a single loss on our side. But the fable Grom wants twinkling in your imagination is that of Faulk's well-documented creeper hunt on Cester Fraesh. The frozen leviathan, heaved from beneath the ice and bolted straight through the cloaca with giant-rending velocity by none other than the Grom HR40. The thing is, hunters don't tend to favor rails. The high-register crack is graslap for most game, that is, room-clearing. Rails worked for Faulk because his trophy possessed no auditory organs, but for the rest, it's just fundamentally a poor choice. Not only with respect to the crack, but also because the sophistication of the instrument is likely to befuddle your hullstock trophy hunter. Seb is a friend of mine and a BC gentleman, so I hurl no shame in his direction, but save for Faulk and the Kano of yore, trophy mongers are a crude bunch, favoring leem powder and crossbows for the most part. But I digress. Short of cake, it's an exceptional longrail with almost no falloff across ranges that push the limit of the rail paradigm. It's a true saber in my book, not some trussed-up hunting toy.

## Roulette

A blatant and shameless play to the substreet success of their original recipe. What niche context mandates the use of a multi-shot flaregun? There is none. Lawson here managed to skirt mass-product regulation while simultaneously validating aftermarket candlestick makers system-wide. While it's not my wont to augment the capacities of low-budget bad actors, I have to admit it was a clever play. The facet that really piques my fancy is the Roulette's namesake feature: the ability to chain-sequence single-shot candlesticks in the generous hopper. While your hullstock outlaw isn't likely to twinge any stalks intellect-wise, I have seen some admittedly sophisticated and downright inspiring use-cases for this unique combat mechanic. The Cove Stalkers rarely sprang for bounties, but after the Clean Container Heist, Dugall Freight was climmering for recompense and the price was right, so the big boys and I chased the Hamlie Family down onto Skarem Scablands. Severely outgunned, they made the correct move and ducked into the Iris Jungle for cover. That's when things got real interesting. Brother Morson Hamile was an ace of the roulette and once we plunged into the thick treescape, the Stalkers got hit with quite the recipe. Brother Morson had his hopper primed to spit a three-stick sequence on repeat. First shot was a gasser, pumping the jungle with haze cloud. Second was a sparkler, igniting the gas in a big fireball. And third came a simple slug, pelted into the gut of any refugee trying to skirt the flames. Poof, whoosh, and boom. Of course, he didn't last long, but I relish the technique to this day. I like to keep my kit pretty straight and that worked for us, but if I were to make a go of it again, I'd be hard tempted to work a few Roulettes into the armory. Could get real creative and with our pull we could probably get Stockton to cook us up some candles bespoke. Some seeperjuice gassers perhaps? Get some flavor past the filters and stir all manner of conniptions with that mask-rending itch. Then just cap 'em off while they're all wet-eyed and flailing.

## Hull Hooker

Pirate junk, cobbled from scrap. Tis a coward's call to clamp a ship, latching like crabs on the belly of a groff. Best be quipt with pads and hull-scrapers to shed the parasites. Typically, if the crew of cowards is worth any flare, the hookers will come after the breachers to lash strap for the boarding party. The scratch is, if your hull ain't chambered, these nasty claws will breach gas and fuck everything up for everyone uncapped, which tends to be everyone on the shuttles and tour boats the cheaper crews like to hit. Fully unnecessary, by my reckoning. Scores of souls for pocket change. Folks drift all sorts of ways, but sometimes it be a mighty challenge to spy the Fringe as anything more then a sinkhole of manners.

Fuck these pricks and all who straddle their cursed fires. Suckflies, they call 'em, the suicidal tools that run recon for boarding parties. The sardonic twist lies in the fact that it requires a lifetime dedicated to the obtuse craft of skillfuly wrangling these jittery missiles to tame them into compliance. More oft than not, the muckbrain pilots render themselves nothing more than a warm-blooded guidance system, delivering ordinance directly to its unintentional target. Now, same parcel to outlaws, the Fringe be full of industrious and wholesome folk and I've heard tale of the valiant and clever use of the scooter in the noble enterprises of defense and rescue. But in large part my unfortunate encounters with the well-monikered Prongseat have been the sites of tragedy, laden with powdered shreds of metal, adrift in The Void.

## Heavy Spigot

In a world governed by rails, the heavy axe is an arcane choice. Lest one has scratches beyond the battlefield, I can't imagine cause to wield such a device save for cosmetic effect, which in some cases is reason enough. The Heavy Spigot is so called, I imagine, for its  penchant to create ample flow when used against soft tissued targets. Tis a showman's weapon and that's no shade on the entertainers among us. While faffery is abhorred, there is good game in the right application of pageantry and I myself have found that having a sturdy, heavesome executioner among the Stalkers can be quite useful in the right situation. If you can make a cove piss hisself in terror, there's a good chance you can shirk the need to add another soul to your own eternal tally.

## Straight Smile

Tis a gruffly debated topic, the merits of teeth on a sword. An abomination in the eyes of many a blade master, though the Straight Smile is not without its worthy advocates. I admit I am merely an observer of the art, relegated to look on from afar with some small drap of envy. For I am a man forged by rails and will go to my grave with a set clung to my hip. Many who choose steel over shot are fools drunk on legend, but those who can take toe and elevate the medium deserve our utmost respect. Of this rare contingent, most I've known would condescend to a toothy instrument, citing them crude and cumbersome. Liable to wedge in bone, jitter and scrape. A cosmetic obsession, likely to turn against the wielder. There is much truth in this take and I've seen it with mine own. Pretenders, pomped and primed, fancied to scare, gunned down or cut down with their precious steel stuck in a ribcage, wrenching with boot as their vain spirits escape. But those who can tame the teeth are a fearsome bunch, no doubt. They come with no presumption of the elegant slice through ether and flesh. No. They come to saw you to pieces. And in the right clutches, they'll carve you with speed, spilling exorbitant fluid as they do. While most broach in follly, there is merit to the mental game. Catch sight of a true carver working magic with a Smile and the doubt will inevitably crimp your fervor. Hesitation will curse your attack. And you'll look in the dirt to see your own warm humors making soup of the soil as the Straight Smile shreds on by.

## Kickback Bombshot

Once the Freight Wars hit the peak of their pendulum and the battle was squarely fixed among the stars, Bombshots sounded at every turn. While common enough in surface-bound skirmishes for some time, it wasn't until Man Earlie's brazen recruitment of some of the cruder elements of Drifterdom that the Fringe's character in combat really came into its own. Float-shooting was a well-practiced art going back to when Chanko sat on the braided throne, but none had seen the scale nor chaos of the EVA bastards of the Freight Wars. Spose that's what you get when you send rustlers and pirates - uninitiated and unhindered - into the realm of total war. And in the great vacuum, bombs are king. No matter the shape, they'll fly true as bolts and far as a longrail's hurl, all while packing the punch of a shipkiller. It's the Kickback that really opened the floods, with stabilizing backthrust synced to shot, ensuring a static platform for an ace bombsling. With war in the Fringe dormant, you don’t see these so much. Too cumbersome for independent scrapes. But once those battalions form up again, as they're bound to, I expect to see the old Kickbackers shake off the dust.

Any device designed for hull-breaching I can't help but regard with an aire of disgust. Call me old-fashioned. Call me staunch. But steeds fight steeds and coves fight coves. Meddle with the order and you pave a slope toward atrocity. I've seen it too many times to be shifted on the matter. Employed primarily by pirates (and the occasional deranged bounty hunter), the Crab will cling and bore. Simple, crude, yet effective. A staple of the boarding party. While most breachers show little discrimination in hole placement, true enthusiasts will often employ a spectral scanner to bring an element of surgery to their craft, disabling electrics, pneumatics, or even life-support with a well-placed prick to the belly of their victims.
