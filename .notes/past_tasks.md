First task will be to continue to flesh out the requirements.

We will start with the core.

Befor we work on core, though, we need to come up with the rules of how the traits convert to rpg stuff.

And before we come up with the rules, we need to scrape the collection's metadata so we can analyze it.

here is a sample url for the collection. this one is for id 2051
https://omniscient.fringedrifters.com/main/metadata/2051.json

Here is the data that comes back

```
